### Slide 7: DRSABCD Overview
**Emergency Response Framework**

**DRSABCD:**
- **D** - Danger
- **R** - Response
- **S** - Send for help
- **A** - Airway
- **B** - Breathing
- **C** - CPR
- **D** - Defibrillation

**Follow this sequence in EVERY emergency!**

---

### Slide 8: D - Danger
**Assess Safety First**

**Check for Dangers:**
- Traffic
- Fire/smoke
- Electricity
- Chemicals
- Structural collapse
- Violence/weapons
- Infectious diseases

**Your Safety First:**
- Don't become a second casualty
- Move casualty only if necessary
- Call for specialized help if needed

**If scene unsafe = Call 000 and wait**

---

### Slide 9: R - Response
**Check Consciousness**

**How to Check:**
1. Approach carefully
2. Introduce yourself
3. Ask: "Can you hear me?"
4. Squeeze shoulders firmly
5. Shout: "Open your eyes!"

**Results:**
- **RESPONSIVE:** Casualty responds = Continue assessment
- **UNRESPONSIVE:** No response = CALL 000 IMMEDIATELY

---

### Slide 10: S - Send for Help
**Call 000**

**When to Call:**
- Unresponsive casualty
- Not breathing normally
- Severe bleeding
- Suspected heart attack/stroke
- Severe burns
- Major trauma
- Any life-threatening situation

**Information to Give:**
- Your location (address/landmarks)
- Phone number
- What happened
- Number of casualties
- Condition of casualty
- First aid being given

**Stay on the line - follow dispatcher instructions**

---

### Slide 11: A - Airway
**Open the Airway**

**Head Tilt, Chin Lift:**
1. Place one hand on forehead
2. Tilt head back gently
3. Place fingers under chin
4. Lift chin up
5. This opens airway

**Check for Obstructions:**
- Look in mouth
- Remove visible objects (if safe)
- Don't do blind finger sweep

**If Suspected Spinal Injury:**
- Minimize head movement
- Jaw thrust technique instead

[Diagram: Head tilt chin lift]

---

### Slide 12: B - Breathing
**Check for Normal Breathing**

**Look, Listen, Feel** (10 seconds maximum):
- **LOOK** for chest rise
- **LISTEN** for breath sounds
- **FEEL** for breath on your cheek

**Normal Breathing:**
- Regular chest movement
- Quiet breath sounds
- Casualty is breathing

**Not Normal:**
- No breathing
- Gasping/gurgling
- Irregular breathing

**If NOT breathing normally = Start CPR**

---

### Slide 13: C - CPR
**Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation**

**When to Start CPR:**
- Unresponsive
- Not breathing normally

**CPR =**
- Chest compressions
- Rescue breaths
- 30 compressions : 2 breaths
- Continue until help arrives or casualty recovers

**We'll cover CPR in detail next section**

---

### Slide 14: D - Defibrillation
**AED - Automated External Defibrillator**

**What is AED:**
- Device that analyzes heart rhythm
- Delivers electric shock if needed
- Can restart stopped heart

**When to Use:**
- During CPR
- As soon as available
- Follow voice prompts
- Safe and easy to use

**AEDs save lives - use them!**

---

## SECTION 3: CPR (Slides 15-30)

### Slide 15: Section Title
**SECTION 3**
**CPR - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation**

[Image: CPR being performed]

---

### Slide 16: Why CPR Works
**Keeping Blood Flowing**

**When Heart Stops:**
- Blood stops circulating
- Oxygen doesn't reach brain
- Brain damage starts in 4-6 minutes
- Death occurs within 10 minutes

**CPR Provides:**
- Manual circulation
- Oxygen to brain and vital organs
- Time until defibrillator arrives
- Increased survival chance

**CPR buys time - it saves lives**

---

### Slide 17: Adult CPR - Compression Position
**Hand Placement**

**Correct Position:**
1. Kneel beside casualty
2. Expose chest
3. Find center of chest (between nipples)
4. Place heel of one hand on sternum
5. Place other hand on top
6. Interlock fingers
7. Keep arms straight
8. Shoulders directly over hands

[Diagram: Hand position for compressions]

---

### Slide 18: Adult CPR - Compression Technique
**How to Compress**

**Technique:**
- **Depth:** 1/3 chest depth (5-6cm)
- **Rate:** 100-120 per minute
- **Rhythm:** "Stayin' Alive" beat
- Push hard, push fast
- Allow full recoil between compressions
- Minimize interruptions

**Tips:**
- Use body weight, not just arms
- Keep arms straight
- Count out loud
- Switch compressors every 2 minutes

---

### Slide 19: Adult CPR - Rescue Breaths
**Giving Breaths**

**Technique:**
1. Maintain head tilt, chin lift
2. Pinch nose closed
3. Seal your mouth over casualty's mouth
4. Give 2 breaths (1 second each)
5. Watch for chest rise
6. If chest doesn't rise, re-position and try again

**Barriers:**
- Use face shield/mask if available
- Reduces infection risk
- Still effective

**If unable/unwilling to give breaths:**
- **Compression-only CPR is acceptable**

---

### Slide 20: Adult CPR - The Cycle
**30:2 Ratio**

**CPR Cycle:**
1. 30 compressions
2. 2 rescue breaths
3. Repeat cycle

**Continue Until:**
- Paramedics arrive and take over
- Casualty starts breathing normally
- AED becomes available
- You are physically unable to continue
- Scene becomes unsafe

**Don't Stop:**
- Even if you're tired - keep going
- Get someone to relieve you if possible
- Every compression counts

---

### Slide 21: Child CPR (1-8 years)
**Modified Technique**

**Differences:**
- **Hand Position:** One or two hands
- **Compression Depth:** 1/3 chest depth (5cm)
- **Compression Rate:** 100-120/min
- **Ratio:** 30:2 (or 15:2 if two rescuers)

**Rescue Breaths:**
- Smaller breaths
- Just enough for chest rise
- Don't over-inflate

**Same Principles:**
- Push hard, push fast
- Minimize interruptions
- Continue until help arrives

---

### Slide 22: Infant CPR (Under 1 year)
**Special Considerations**

**Technique:**
- **Fingers:** Two fingers in center of chest
- **Position:** Just below nipple line
- **Depth:** 1/3 chest depth (4cm)
- **Rate:** 100-120/min
- **Ratio:** 30:2 (or 15:2 if two rescuers)

**Rescue Breaths:**
- Cover mouth AND nose with your mouth
- Very small breaths
- Just enough for gentle chest rise

**Gentle but Effective:**
- Infant's chest is fragile
- But CPR is still critical

[Diagram: Two-finger infant CPR]

---

### Slide 23: Compression-Only CPR
**Alternative Method**

**When to Use:**
- Unwilling to give breaths
- No barrier device available
- Infection concerns
- Vomit/blood present

**Technique:**
- Continuous chest compressions
- No breaths
- Same rate: 100-120/min
- Don't stop until help arrives

**Effectiveness:**
- Nearly as effective as full CPR for first 10 minutes
- Better than doing nothing
- Blood still has residual oxygen

**ALWAYS better to do something than nothing**

---

### Slide 24: Recovery Position
**For Breathing Casualties**

**When to Use:**
- Casualty is breathing
- Casualty is unconscious
- No suspected spinal injury

**Purpose:**
- Keeps airway open
- Allows fluids to drain
- Prevents choking on vomit/tongue

**Technique:**
1. Kneel beside casualty
2. Extend arm nearest you
3. Bend far knee
4. Roll casualty toward you
5. Position head to maintain open airway
6. Monitor breathing continuously

[Diagram: Recovery position steps]

---

### Slide 25: Choking - Recognizing
**Airway Obstruction**

**Signs of Choking:**

**Mild vs Severe:**
- **Mild:** Can cough, speak, breathe (encourage coughing)
- **Severe:** Cannot cough, speak, or breathe (ACT IMMEDIATELY)

**Ask:** "Are you choking?"

---

### Slide 26: Choking - Back Blows
**First Response**

**Technique:**
1. Stand beside and slightly behind
2. Support chest with one hand
3. Lean casualty forward
4. Give 5 sharp blows between shoulder blades
5. Check if object dislodged
6. If not, move to abdominal thrusts

**Use heel of hand:**
- Firm, sharp strikes
- Upward angle
- Check after each blow

[Diagram: Back blow position]

---

### Slide 27: Choking - Abdominal Thrusts
**Heimlich Maneuver**

**Technique:**
1. Stand behind casualty
2. Place fist above navel, below sternum
3. Grasp fist with other hand
4. Pull sharply inward and upward
5. Give 5 thrusts
6. Alternate with 5 back blows

**Continue Until:**
- Object dislodges
- Casualty becomes unconscious
- Paramedics arrive

**If casualty becomes unconscious:**

- Start CPR

[Diagram: Abdominal thrust position]

---

### Slide 28: Choking - Infant
**Modified Technique**

**Infants (under 1 year):**

**Back Blows:**
1. Place infant face-down on your forearm
2. Support head
3. Give 5 back blows with heel of hand

**Chest Thrusts:**
1. Turn infant face-up
2. Give 5 chest thrusts (like CPR compressions)
3. Alternate back blows and chest thrusts

**NEVER:**
