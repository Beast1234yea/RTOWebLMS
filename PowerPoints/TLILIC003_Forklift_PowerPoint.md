---

### Slide 14: Hazard vs Risk
**Understanding the Difference**

**HAZARD:**
- Something with POTENTIAL to cause harm
- Examples: Moving forklift, elevated load, uneven ground

**RISK:**
- The LIKELIHOOD and CONSEQUENCE of harm occurring
- Risk = Likelihood × Consequence

**Example:**
- Hazard: Forklift operating near pedestrians
- Risk: HIGH - Likely to result in serious injury if collision occurs

---

### Slide 15: Hierarchy of Control
**Managing Risks - Most to Least Effective**

1. **ELIMINATION** - Remove the hazard completely
2. **SUBSTITUTION** - Replace with something safer
3. **ENGINEERING CONTROLS** - Isolate people from hazard
4. **ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS** - Change work procedures
5. **PPE** - Protect the worker

**Example:**
- Elimination: Automate process (no forklift needed)
- Engineering: Install barriers to separate pedestrians
- Admin: Implement exclusion zones
- PPE: High-vis clothing for workers

---

### Slide 16: Duty of Care Summary
**Your Duty of Care**

**Remember:**
- You have legal and moral responsibility
- If unsure, STOP and ASK
- Report hazards immediately
- Never take shortcuts
- Look after yourself and others

**"Safety is everyone's responsibility"**

## SECTION 3: FORKLIFT COMPONENTS (Slides 17-26)

### Slide 17: Section Title
**SECTION 3**
**Forklift Components & Safety Features**

[Image: Forklift with component callouts]

---

### Slide 18: Major Components Overview
**Forklift Anatomy**

**Main Components:**
1. Power source (engine/battery)
2. Counterweight
3. Mast assembly
4. Carriage and tynes (forks)
5. Overhead guard
6. Operator compartment
7. Wheels and steering
8. Hydraulic system

[Diagram: Labeled forklift components]

---

### Slide 19: The Counterweight
**Balance System**

**Purpose:**
- Provides balance to offset load weight
- Prevents tip-over when loaded
- Located at rear of forklift

**How It Works:**
- Weight balances around the front axle (fulcrum)
- Heavier loads require more counterbalance
- Operator weight also contributes

**Important:** Never exceed rated capacity - counterweight is sized for specific loads

[Diagram: Counterbalance principle]

---

### Slide 20: The Stability Triangle
**Understanding Forklift Stability**

**Three Points:**
1. Two front wheels (or wheel centers)
2. Center of drive axle (rear)

**Stability Triangle:**
- Forms a triangle connecting these three points
- Center of gravity must stay INSIDE triangle
- If CG moves outside = TIP OVER!

**Factors Affecting Stability:**
- Load weight and height
- Mast angle (forward/backward)
- Speed and turning
- Ground conditions and slopes

[Diagram: Stability triangle with CG marked]

---

### Slide 21: Mast & Carriage Assembly
**Lifting Mechanism**

**Mast Components:**
- **Inner mast:** Moves up/down (extends)
- **Outer mast:** Fixed to forklift frame
- **Lift chains:** Raise/lower carriage
- **Lift cylinders:** Hydraulic power

**Carriage:**
- Mounts to mast
- Holds tynes (forks)
- Can tilt forward/backward

**Tynes (Forks):**
- Slide loads underneath
- Adjustable spacing
- Various lengths available

[Image: Mast assembly detail]

---

### Slide 22: Hydraulic System
**Power & Control**

**Components:**

2. **Seatbelt** - Keeps operator in protected zone
3. **Horn** - Audible warning
4. **Lights** - Visibility (headlights, tail lights, beacons)
5. **Load Backrest** - Prevents load sliding back
6. **Tilt Lockout** - Prevents over-tilting
7. **Deadman System** - Stops operation if operator leaves seat

**Never Disable or Bypass Safety Devices!**

---

### Slide 26: Data Plate & Capacity Chart
**Critical Information**

**Data Plate Shows:**
- Manufacturer and model
- Serial number
- Rated capacity (kg)
- Load center (mm)
- Attachment information
- Weight of forklift

**Location:** Usually on mast or dashboard

**Why Important:**
- Tells you maximum safe load
- Required for load calculations
- Must check before every different forklift

[Image: Sample data plate]

---

## SECTION 4: LOAD THEORY (Slides 27-35)

### Slide 27: Section Title
**SECTION 4**
**Load Theory & Calculations**

[Image: Load on forklift with measurement indicators]

---

### Slide 28: Understanding Load Center
**What is Load Center?**

**Definition:**
- Horizontal distance from face of tynes to center of gravity of load
- Measured in millimeters (mm)
- Standard load center: 500mm for most forklifts

**Why It Matters:**
- Load center affects capacity
- Further from tynes = Less capacity
- Must calculate for non-standard loads

[Diagram: Load center measurement]

---

### Slide 29: Rated Capacity
**Understanding Forklift Ratings**

**Rated Capacity:**
- Maximum weight forklift can safely lift
- Rated at SPECIFIC load center (usually 500mm)
- Reduces as load center increases

**Example:**
- Forklift rated 2500kg @ 500mm LC
- Same forklift may only lift 2000kg @ 600mm LC

**NEVER Exceed Rated Capacity!**

---

### Slide 30: Load Center Calculation
**De-Rating Formula**

**When load center is GREATER than rated:**

**New Capacity = (Rated Capacity × Rated LC) ÷ Actual LC**

**Example:**
- Rated: 2500kg @ 500mm
- Actual load center: 600mm
- Calculation: (2500 × 500) ÷ 600 = 2083kg
- **New capacity: 2083kg**

**If your load weighs more than new capacity = DO NOT LIFT**

---

### Slide 31: Calculating Load Center
**Finding Center of Gravity**

**For Uniform Loads:**
- Load center = Half the load depth

**Example:**
- Pallet is 1200mm deep
- Load center = 1200 ÷ 2 = 600mm

**For Uneven Loads:**
- Must calculate or measure actual CG
- Consider weight distribution
- Heavier items shift CG toward them

[Diagram: CG calculation examples]

---

### Slide 32: Combined Center of Gravity
**Multiple Items**

**When Lifting Multiple Items:**

**Formula:**
CG = (W1 × D1) + (W2 × D2) ÷ (W1 + W2)

**Example:**
- Item 1: 500kg at 400mm
- Item 2: 300kg at 800mm
- Combined CG = (500×400)+(300×800) ÷ (500+300)
- = 540,000 ÷ 800 = **675mm**

---

### Slide 33: Attachment Effects
**De-Rating for Attachments**

**Attachments Reduce Capacity:**
- Side shifter: -100 to -200kg typically
- Fork positioner: -150 to -250kg
- Clamps: -200 to -500kg
- Extension tynes: -100kg

**Process:**
1. Start with rated capacity
2. Subtract attachment weight
3. Subtract attachment de-rating
4. Apply load center formula if needed

**Always check attachment data plate!**

---

### Slide 34: Practical Example
**Real-World Calculation**

**Scenario:**
- Forklift: 3000kg @ 500mm
- Side-shift fitted: 150kg weight, 100kg de-rating
- Load: 2400kg @ 600mm

**Step 1:** Adjust for attachment
- 3000kg - 150kg - 100kg = 2750kg

**Step 2:** Adjust for load center
- (2750 × 500) ÷ 600 = 2292kg

**Result:** Can safely lift 2292kg at 600mm
**Load is 2400kg = TOO HEAVY - DO NOT LIFT**

---

### Slide 35: Load Theory Summary
**Key Points to Remember**

**Always:**
- ✓ Check data plate
- ✓ Measure/estimate load center
- ✓ Calculate if load center exceeds rated
- ✓ Account for attachments
- ✓ Include pallet weight
- ✓ When in doubt, DON'T LIFT

**Formula to Remember:**
**New Capacity = (Rated × Rated LC) ÷ Actual LC**

---
