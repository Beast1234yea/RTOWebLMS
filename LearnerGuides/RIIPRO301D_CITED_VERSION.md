### 1.2 Crushing and Screening Operations

Crushing and screening operations are essential processes in the construction, mining, quarrying, and recycling industries. These operations involve reducing the size of raw materials and separating them based on size or other characteristics to meet specific requirements.

**Crushing operations:**
Crushing is the process of breaking down large rocks, stones, or other solid materials into smaller pieces, usually for the purpose of creating aggregates or preparing materials for further processing. Different types of crushers are used for this purpose:
- **Jaw crushers** - Primary crushing
- **Impact crushers** - Secondary crushing
- **Cone crushers** - Tertiary crushing
- **Gyratory crushers** - Large-scale primary crushing

**Screening operations:**
Screening is the process of separating materials based on their size by passing them through sieves or screens. Various types of screens are used:
- **Vibrating screens**
- **Grizzly screens**
- **Trommel screens**
- **Scalping screens**
