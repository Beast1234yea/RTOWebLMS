### 1.2 What are Bridge and Gantry Cranes?

**Bridge Crane:**
- An overhead crane suspended from a bridge structure
- Hoist moves along a trolley that traverses the bridge runway
- Bridge spans across a facility and operates on overhead runway beams
- Typically used in manufacturing, workshops, warehouses, and loading facilities
- Capacity ranges from 1 to 100+ tonnes depending on design

**Gantry Crane:**
- An overhead crane mounted on legs or towers running on ground-level rails
- Hoist moves along a trolley that traverses the bridge runway
- Entire structure (bridge and supports) moves along ground rails
- Used in outdoor applications, shipyards, container yards, loading areas
- Capacity ranges from 5 to 500 tonnes depending on design

Both types operate on similar principles but have different mounting and movement characteristics.

## 5. SAFE OPERATING PROCEDURES

### 5.1 Pre-Lift Planning

**Requirement:** All crane lifts must be properly planned before commencement.

**Lift Planning must include:**

✓ **Load Assessment:**
- Identify the load to be lifted
- Determine actual weight (weighing or calculation)
- Verify weight does not exceed crane capacity
- Assess load shape and size
- Identify center of gravity
- Check for unstable loads (liquids, loose items)

✓ **Lift Plan Details:**
- Specify lift points and rigging method
- Identify path for crane and load movement
- Determine starting and finishing positions
- Identify hazards (obstacles, pedestrians, overhead)
- Specify communication method (radio, hand signals)
- Plan emergency procedures

✓ **Personnel Assignment:**
- Designate qualified operator
- Assign competent spotter/dogman
- Identify qualified rigger
- Establish signal system (if hand signals used)
- Brief all personnel on lift plan
- Assign supervisor responsibility

**Source:** TLILIC0006 Element 1 - Prepare to operate bridge and gantry crane, training.gov.au

### 5.2 Load Charts and Capacity

**Load Capacity Plate (Data Plate):**

Every crane has a load capacity plate that specifies:
- Maximum rated load capacity
- Hoist identification and capacity
- Bridge span and runway information
- Structural limitations
- Environmental conditions (wind limits)

**Legal Requirement:**

> "A person must not exceed the weight limits, or the manufacturer's specifications, for the plant."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 214 (Duty to not exceed weight limits). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**Reading Load Charts:**

Load charts show the relationship between:
- Load weight
- Hook position (distance from support)
- Available capacity at that position
- Speed of operation at different loads
- Environmental factors (wind, temperature)

**Critical Principle:**
- As load moves further from support, capacity may decrease
- Never exceed rated capacity even if load appears light
- Consider load swing and impact forces
- Account for acceleration/deceleration forces

**Source:** TLILIC0006 Element 3 - Determine load capacity and safe positioning, training.gov.au

### 5.3 Operating the Bridge/Gantry Crane

**Pre-Lift Verification:**

Before each lift:

1. **Verify the load:**
   - Weight is known and documented
   - Does not exceed crane capacity
   - Properly rigged and secured
   - Inspection by rigger completed

2. **Verify the area:**
   - No personnel under or near load path
   - Ground clear of obstacles
   - Adequate clearance to structures
   - No overhead obstructions

3. **Verify communication:**
   - All personnel can hear signals/radio
   - Hand signals clearly understood
   - Secondary communication available

4. **Verify the crane:**
   - Pre-operational check completed
   - No faults identified
   - Brakes functioning properly
   - All controls responsive

**Operational Safety:**

✓ **Smooth Operation:**
- Accelerate and decelerate smoothly
- Avoid jerky movements that swing the load
- Maintain control of load at all times
- Monitor load movement visually

✓ **Load Height:**
- Raise load only enough to clear obstacles
- Do not raise load higher than necessary
- Keep load visible at all times (may require spotter)
- Lower load carefully to landing area

✓ **Load Movement:**
- Move load only when clear of personnel
- Move slowly and carefully
- Avoid sudden changes in direction
- Stop if any uncertainty about clearance

✓ **Communication During Lift:**
- Maintain constant communication with team
- Follow only signals from designated signaler
- Confirm load is secure before movement
- Announce all movements

## 6. LOAD HANDLING AND RIGGING

### 6.1 Rigging Requirements

**Importance of Proper Rigging:**

The safety of a crane lift depends critically on proper rigging of the load.

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that lifting equipment used at a workplace is suitable for the work and is used in a manner that is safe."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 207 (Lifting equipment). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**Rigging Components:**

- Slings (wire rope, chain, nylon, polyester)
- Hooks and shackles
- Spreader bars
- Lift lugs (lifting points on equipment)
- Load indicator devices
- Taglines for load control

**Rigging Inspection:**

Before each lift:
- Visual inspection of all sling material
- Check for fraying, damage, or wear
- Verify hooks are not bent or cracked
- Confirm safe working load marked on equipment
- Ensure rigging method appropriate for load

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2016). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risks of plant in the workplace (Section 3.3: Rigging and load control). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risks-plant-workplace

### 6.2 Load Positioning and Balance

**Balanced Load:**

A properly balanced load:
- Is supported by rigging at its center of gravity
- Does not tilt or rotate under the hook
- Hangs vertically under the hoist hook
- Remains stable during movement

**Identifying Center of Gravity:**

For symmetrical objects:
- Center of gravity is at geometric center
- All rigging points should be equidistant from center

For asymmetrical objects:
- Visual inspection or calculation required
- May need spreader bars to equalize rigging
- Spotter required if center of gravity unclear

**Load Swing Control:**

To prevent dangerous load swinging:
- Accelerate and decelerate smoothly
- Use taglines to control load movement
- Avoid sudden directional changes
- Keep load low during movement
- Lower load gradually to landing area

**Source:** TLILIC0006 Element 3 - Manage load positioning and control, training.gov.au

### 6.3 Communication and Coordination

**Signal System:**

All personnel must understand and follow the signal system:

**Hand Signals (if used):**
- Hoist up - arm up, fingers curled
- Lower load - arm down, fingers curled
- Stop - arm raised, palm out
- Swing load - pointing in direction
- Emergency stop - arms crossed overhead

**Radio Communication:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Confirm all instructions before proceeding
- Use standardized terminology
- Change to emergency frequency if needed

**Spotter Responsibilities:**

The spotter (dogman):
- Maintains visual contact with load
- Watches for obstacles and hazards
- Directs load movement to precise position
- Signals operator when landing area clear
- Stops operation if danger detected
- Ensures area remains clear during lift
