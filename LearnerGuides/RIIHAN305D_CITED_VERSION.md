### Operating Limitations

**Capacity Limitations:**
> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that plant, including any part of plant designed to support a load, is not loaded beyond its rated capacity."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 205 - Compliance with rated capacity. Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**Rated Capacity Considerations:**
- Rated capacity displayed on crane and on rated capacity indicator
- Includes weight of rigging gear and lifting beam (if used)
- Capacity may vary with radius (for some crane types)
- Multiple part reeving affects capacity
- Dynamic loading during acceleration/deceleration
- Side loading prohibited (lifts must be vertical)

**Environmental Limitations:**
- Wind speed limits (typically cease operations above 50 km/h for outdoor cranes)
- Poor visibility conditions
- Electrical storms
- Temperature extremes affecting equipment
- Ice or snow on runway or controls

**Operational Prohibitions:**
- Never exceed rated capacity
- Never leave load suspended and unattended
- Never carry loads over people
- Never use crane to drag or pull loads horizontally
- Never use hoist limit switches as operating controls
- Never lift people (unless crane specifically designed and certified for personnel lifting)

### Communication During Lifting Operations

**Standard Hand Signals:**

When verbal or radio communication is not used, standard hand signals must be understood by both crane operator and dogger/rigger:

## Load Handling and Rigging

### Rigging Requirements

**Competency for Rigging:**

Personnel attaching loads to crane hooks must hold appropriate qualifications:
- **Dogging Licence (DG)** - For basic slinging and rigging operations
- **Rigging Licence** - For more complex rigging (RI, RB, or RA class depending on work)

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Schedule 3 - Classes of high risk work (Dogging and Rigging). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

### Weight Estimation

**Load Weight Determination:**

Before lifting, load weight must be determined by:
- Manufacturer's specifications or markings
- Documentation (delivery dockets, engineering drawings)
- Weighing on scales
- Calculation (volume × material density)
- Test lift on calibrated equipment

**Common Material Densities:**
- Steel: 7,850 kg/m³
- Aluminium: 2,700 kg/m³
- Concrete: 2,400 kg/m³
- Timber (hardwood): 900-1,100 kg/m³

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2016). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risks of plant in the workplace (Section 3.2.8.7: Load estimation).

### Slinging Methods

**Sling Configurations:**

**Vertical Hitch:**
- Single sling vertical from hook
- Load capacity = sling rated capacity
- Load must have single central lifting point
- Load must be balanced

**Choker Hitch:**
- Sling passed through itself around load
- Load capacity = 75% of sling rated capacity
- Used for loads without lifting points
- Multiple chokers for long loads

**Basket Hitch:**
- Sling passed under load, both ends on hook
- Load capacity = 2× sling rated capacity (if vertical) or less if at angle
- Good load stability
- Requires smooth load base

**Multi-Leg Slings:**
- 2-leg, 3-leg, or 4-leg configurations
- Capacity depends on sling angle
- Minimum sling angle 30° from horizontal (preferred 45-60°)
- Uneven loading reduces effective capacity

**Sling Angle Factor:**
- 90° (vertical): 100% capacity
- 60°: 87% capacity per leg
- 45°: 71% capacity per leg
- 30°: 50% capacity per leg

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2016). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risks of plant in the workplace (Section 3.2.8.8: Slinging methods and sling angles).

### Load Center of Gravity

**Balanced Lifting:**

Load center of gravity must be:
- Directly under crane hook
- Vertical lift to prevent swing
- Considered for uneven loads
- Adjusted with sling placement

**Unbalanced Loads:**
- Offset center of gravity causes tipping
- Adjust sling attachment points
- Use spreader beam or lifting frame
- Secure loose items

## Hazard Identification and Risk Control

### Hierarchy of Control

**Risk Control Framework:**

> "A duty holder who has a duty to manage risks to health and safety under the regulations must manage the risks by:
> (a) eliminating risks to health and safety so far as is reasonably practicable; or
> (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate risks to health and safety, minimising those risks so far as is reasonably practicable by implementing control measures in accordance with this regulation."
