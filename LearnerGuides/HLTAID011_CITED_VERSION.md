## 2. RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY SITUATION

### 2.1 Recognise and Assess an Emergency Situation

An emergency situation is one where there is immediate risk of injury, illness or death to a person.

Common emergency situations requiring first aid include:
- Unconsciousness or altered consciousness
- Breathing difficulties
- Chest pain or heart attack
- Severe bleeding
- Shock
- Fractures and dislocations
- Burns
- Poisoning
- Allergic reactions

The first step in any emergency is to quickly assess the situation to determine:
- What has happened
- How many casualties there are
- What injuries or illnesses are present
- What dangers still exist

---

### 2.2 Ensure Safety - DRSABCD Action Plan

The DRSABCD action plan is the recommended approach for managing emergency situations in Australia.

**DRSABCD stands for:**

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **D** | **Danger** | Check for dangers to yourself, bystanders and the casualty |
| **R** | **Response** | Check if the casualty is conscious and responsive |
| **S** | **Send for help** | Call 000 for an ambulance |
| **A** | **Airway** | Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin |
| **B** | **Breathing** | Check if the casualty is breathing normally |
| **C** | **CPR** | Start CPR if the casualty is unconscious and not breathing normally |
| **D** | **Defibrillation** | Attach an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) as soon as available |

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2021). ANZCOR Guideline 1 - Introduction to Resuscitation (Section 3.2: Basic Life Support). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

**Always ensure scene safety before approaching the casualty.**

---

### 2.3 Assess the Casualty

Once the scene is safe, assess the casualty by:

1. **Checking for response:**
   - Talk to the casualty - "Can you hear me?" "Open your eyes"
   - Squeeze their shoulders firmly
   - If no response, they are unconscious

2. **Sending for help:**
   - Call 000 immediately or ask someone else to call
   - Stay on the line and follow dispatcher instructions

3. **Opening the airway:**
   - Place one hand on the forehead
   - Place two fingers under the chin
   - Gently tilt the head back

4. **Checking for normal breathing:**
   - Look for chest movement
   - Listen for breath sounds
   - Feel for breath on your cheek
   - Take no more than 10 seconds

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 8 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (Section 4: Recognition of cardiac arrest). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

---

### 2.4 Seek Assistance from Emergency Services

**Calling 000:**

When calling emergency services (000), provide:
- Your location (address, landmarks, GPS coordinates if available)
- Phone number you're calling from
- What has happened
- Number of casualties
- Condition of casualties
- First aid being provided

**Stay on the line** until the dispatcher tells you to hang up. They may provide instructions for care until paramedics arrive.

**Emergency Numbers in Australia:**
- **000** - Police, Fire, Ambulance (from any phone)
- **112** - Emergency number from mobile phones (connects to 000)
- **106** - Text-based emergency service for people with hearing or speech difficulties

---

## 3. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR)

### 3.1 When to Perform CPR

CPR should be started immediately when a casualty is:
- Unconscious (unresponsive)
- Not breathing normally

**Do not delay** - every second counts. Brain damage begins within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest.

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 8 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (Section 1: Introduction). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

---

### 3.2 CPR Technique - Adults

**CPR Ratio: 30 compressions : 2 breaths**

**Chest Compressions:**

> "Compress the lower half of the sternum to a depth of approximately 5-6 cm, at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, allowing complete chest recoil between compressions."

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 8 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (Section 5.2: Chest compressions). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

**Technique:**
1. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest (lower half of sternum)
2. Place the other hand on top and interlock fingers
3. Keep arms straight, shoulders directly over hands
4. Compress 5-6 cm deep
5. Release completely between compressions
6. Compress at a rate of 100-120 per minute (almost 2 per second)
7. After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths

**Rescue Breaths:**
1. Ensure airway is open (head tilt, chin lift)
2. Pinch the nose closed
3. Make a seal over the casualty's mouth with your mouth
4. Blow steadily for about 1 second - watch for chest rise
5. Take a breath yourself, then give a second rescue breath
6. Return to chest compressions immediately

**Continue CPR until:**
- The casualty shows signs of life (movement, breathing, consciousness)
- Paramedics arrive and take over
- You are physically unable to continue
- The situation becomes unsafe

---

### 3.3 CPR for Children (1-8 years) and Infants (under 1 year)

**Children (1-8 years):**
- Use the same technique as adults
- Compress approximately one-third of chest depth
- Use one or two hands depending on child size
- Ratio remains 30:2 (or 15:2 if two trained rescuers)

**Infants (under 1 year):**
- Use two fingers for compressions
- Position fingers on lower half of sternum, just below nipple line
- Compress approximately one-third of chest depth
- For rescue breaths, cover both mouth and nose with your mouth
- Ratio: 30:2 (or 15:2 if two trained rescuers)

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 8 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (Sections 5.4 & 5.5). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

---

### 3.4 Compression-Only CPR

If you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths, **provide continuous chest compressions**.

Compression-only CPR is better than no CPR at all.

> "If a rescuer is unwilling or unable to deliver rescue breaths, continuous chest compressions should be provided."

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 8 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (Section 5.6: Compression-only CPR). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

---

## 4. AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED)

### 4.1 What is an AED?

An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a portable device that can analyze the heart's rhythm and deliver an electric shock (defibrillation) if needed to restore normal heart rhythm.

**AEDs are designed to be used by anyone** - even people without medical training. The device provides voice and visual prompts to guide you.

---

### 4.2 When to Use an AED

Use an AED whenever:
- A person is unconscious and not breathing normally
- An AED is available

**Do not delay CPR to get an AED** - start CPR immediately and have someone fetch the AED.

> "An AED should be applied as soon as it is available. Minimise interruptions to chest compressions during AED application and operation."

**Source:** Australian Resuscitation Council. (2016). ANZCOR Guideline 11 - Automated External Defibrillation (Section 4.2: AED use during CPR). Retrieved November 2025, from https://resus.org.au/guidelines/

---

### 4.3 How to Use an AED

**Steps for AED Use:**

1. **Turn on the AED** (open lid or press power button)
2. **Follow the voice prompts**
3. **Attach the electrode pads** to the casualty's bare chest:
   - One pad on the upper right chest (below collarbone)
   - One pad on the lower left chest (below and to the side of left nipple)
   - Ensure pads are firmly attached to dry skin
4. **Stand clear** - ensure no one is touching the casualty while the AED analyzes
5. **If a shock is advised:**
   - Ensure everyone stands clear
   - Press the shock button when prompted
   - Resume CPR immediately after shock
6. **If no shock is advised:**
   - Resume CPR immediately
7. **Continue following AED prompts** until paramedics arrive

**AED Safety:**
- Ensure the casualty's chest is dry
- Remove any medication patches from the chest
- Do not use in explosive atmospheres or near flammable materials
- AEDs are safe to use in wet conditions, but dry the chest first
- It is safe to use an AED on a metal surface
