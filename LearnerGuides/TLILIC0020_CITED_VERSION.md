- Load weight (kg or tonnes)
- Load radius (distance from crane center to load center)
- Boom angle (height of jib)
- Safety factor (typically 1.25 or greater)

**Formula:**
```
Load Moment = Load Weight (kg) × Load Radius (m)
Safe to lift if: Load Moment ≤ Crane Capacity at that radius
```

**Operators and supervisors must understand load calculations.**
