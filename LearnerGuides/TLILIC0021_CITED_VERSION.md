## 3. CRANE SYSTEMS AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES

### 3.1 Rated Capacity and Load Charts

**Understanding rated capacity is fundamental to safe crane operation.**

**Rated Capacity Definition:**

The rated capacity is the maximum safe working load under specified conditions:
- At a specific boom length
- At a specific radius (distance from crane centerline)
- At a specific boom angle
- Under specified stability conditions

**Load Chart Components:**

Load charts specify capacity at multiple configurations:

✓ **Radius** - Horizontal distance from crane to load center of gravity
✓ **Boom angle** - Elevation of the jib (typically 40° to 80°)
✓ **Boom length** - Extended length of the jib
✓ **Outrigger extension** - How far outriggers are deployed
✓ **Derating factors** - Reduced capacity for adverse conditions

**Critical Safety Rule:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that a load does not exceed the rated capacity of the equipment used to lift the load."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 40 (Safe use of plant). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

---

### 3.2 Advanced Crane Safety Systems

**Large capacity cranes (up to 100 tonnes) include sophisticated safety systems:**

**Load Moment Indicator (LMI):**
- Continuously monitors load weight and radius
- Calculates load moment (weight × radius)
- Provides audio/visual alarms when approaching capacity
- Prevents overloading with limiter function

**Anti-Two-Block Device:**
- Prevents hook block from hitting boom tip
- Critical for safety when load swings or hook reaches limit

**Anemometer (Wind Speed Monitor):**
- Measures wind speed continuously
- Warns operator when speed exceeds safe limits
- Automatically stops operation if wind too strong

**Level Indicator:**
- Ensures crane maintains level (parallel to ground)
- Prevents tilting which affects capacity
- Critical for stability calculations

**Outrigger Pressure Monitoring:**
- Confirms outriggers are fully extended
- Monitors ground pressure under each pad
- Alerts if pressure exceeds ground capacity

---

### 3.3 Load Swinging and Control

**Large loads have significant momentum and can swing dangerously.**

**Factors affecting swing:**

- **Boom slew** (rotation) - Causes outward swing
- **Load lowering** - Can create pendulum effect
- **Wind** - Pushes swinging load further
- **Cable stretch** - Extends swing distance

**Control measures:**

✓ **Tag lines** - Guide ropes to control load movement
✓ **Slow movements** - Reduce momentum and swing
✓ **Anti-sway software** - Automatic boom speed reduction
✓ **Load control devices** - Mechanical dampers or weight distribution systems
✓ **Exclusion zones** - Keep personnel away from swing path

## 5. ADVANCED LOAD PLANNING

### 5.1 Complex Lift Planning

**Large capacity lifts (up to 100 tonnes) require detailed planning.**

**Lift planning process:**

**Phase 1: Load Assessment**
- Verify load weight (use certified weighbridge)
- Determine load dimensions (height, width, depth)
- Identify center of gravity (critical for balance)
- Assess load characteristics (fragile, unusual shape, etc.)

**Phase 2: Crane Selection**
- Confirm crane capacity for planned lift
- Verify boom length and reach requirements
- Check stability margins and safety factors
- Assess wind condition limits

**Phase 3: Rigging Design**
- Select appropriate slings and hardware
- Calculate sling angles and tensions
- Design spreader bar or load distribution
- Plan for center of gravity adjustment if needed

**Phase 4: Site Assessment**
- Check ground bearing capacity
- Identify overhead hazards (power lines, structures)
- Assess clearances (vertical and horizontal)
- Identify underground services

**Phase 5: Hazard and Risk Assessment**
- Use formal risk assessment process
- Identify all potential incidents
- Determine control hierarchy
- Assign responsibility and communication

**Phase 6: Lift Plan Documentation**
- Written lift plan (for complex lifts)
- Site diagram with exclusion zones
- Risk assessment results
- Contingency plans (if lift can't proceed)

---

### 5.2 Load Weight and Center of Gravity

**Accurate load weight is non-negotiable.**

**Verification methods:**

✓ **Manufacturer documentation** - Official weight specification
✓ **Weighbridge** - Certified scale for accurate measurement
✓ **Certified weight calculation** - By engineer using material density
✓ **Previous lift records** - Only if load is identical to previously weighed item

**Never estimate or assume load weight.**

**Center of Gravity (CoG):**

The CoG is the point where the entire load weight is considered to concentrate. For safe rigging:

- CoG must be accurately determined
- Slings must distribute load evenly
- Load must be balanced to prevent rotation
- Load must hang plumb (vertically)

**For loads with uncertain CoG, engineer calculations are required.**

**Source:** TLILIC0021 Element 3 - Load assessment and rigging - training.gov.au

---

### 5.3 Capacity Calculations for Complex Configurations

**Load moment calculations ensure safety:**

**Formula:**

```
Load Moment (tonne·m) = Load Weight (tonnes) × Radius (metres)
```

**Capacity verification:**

At a given radius and boom angle:
- Load Moment must be ≤ Crane Capacity at that configuration
- Safety factor typically 1.25 to 1.5
- Calculation must be documented

**Example:**
```
Load: 50 tonnes
Radius: 20 metres
Load Moment: 50 × 20 = 1,000 tonne·m

If crane capacity at 20m radius = 850 tonne·m
Result: UNSAFE - Load exceeds capacity

If crane capacity at 20m radius = 1,500 tonne·m
Result: SAFE - Load within capacity
```

**For critical lifts, professional rigger or engineer calculations required.**

---

### 6.2 Professional Rigging and Load Control

**For large capacity lifts, professional riggers are often required.**

**Rigging principles:**

**Four-Point Suspension:**
- Distribute load across minimum 4 attachment points
- Reduces stress on individual attachment points
- Improves load stability
- Prevents load rotation

**Sling Angle Optimization:**

| Sling Angle | Load Distribution | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Vertical (90°) | 1.0× per sling | Most stable, preferred |
| 60° from vertical | 1.15× per sling | Acceptable for most lifts |
| 45° from vertical | 1.41× per sling | Increases stress significantly |
| 30° from vertical | 1.93× per sling | Very high stress, avoid if possible |

**Shallow angles (< 45°) increase sling tension and should be avoided if possible.**

**Load Control Devices:**
- Tag lines prevent swinging and rotation
- Spreader bars distribute load evenly
- Stabilizing frames for unusual loads
- Shock absorbers for delicate items

- Lower - Arm lowered, fingers pointing down
- Move forward - Arm extended forward, pushing gesture
- Move backward - Arm extended backward, pulling gesture
- Stop - Arm raised, palm up (STOP means immediate halt)
- Slew left/right - Arm extended, indicating direction

**Two-Way Communication:**
- Radio or hand signals maintained at all times
- Non-verbal signals for noise situations
- Pre-lift briefing covers all signals
- Test communication before lift begins

**Personnel Control:**
- Exclusion zones established around load
- No personnel under suspended load
- Spotters watch for hazards
- No entry to work area until load secured

3. **Assess likelihood** - How likely is the incident?
4. **Assess severity** - How serious would injury be?
5. **Evaluate existing controls** - Are current controls adequate?
6. **Determine if acceptable** - Is risk ALARP?
7. **Design additional controls if needed** - Using hierarchy of control
8. **Implement controls** - Put them in place
9. **Review effectiveness** - Check controls are working

**Risk levels:**

- **Intolerable:** Must be reduced immediately, operation cannot proceed

### 7.3 Control Hierarchy for Heavy Lifting

**The Hierarchy of Control prioritises most effective measures:**

| Level | Control Type | Action | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **1** | **Elimination** | Remove the hazard | Use alternative method instead of crane lift |
| **2** | **Substitution** | Replace with less hazardous option | Use smaller crane, multiple lifts instead of one |
| **3** | **Isolation** | Separate hazard from people | Exclusive use area, exclusion zones |
| **4** | **Engineering** | Use equipment/systems to control | Load limiters, anti-sway devices, safety cables |
| **5** | **Administrative** | Rules, procedures, training | Lift plans, pre-lift briefings, permits, supervision |
| **6** | **PPE** | Personal protective equipment | Hard hats, high-visibility clothing (least effective) |

**Controls are most effective when combined across multiple levels.**
