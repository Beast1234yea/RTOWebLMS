### 1.2 Gas Testing Safety Information

Your organisation will have access to, and will have applied, the relevant safety information in order to keep all people safe in all operational situations.

**Legal Framework:**

Under Model WHS legislation, persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs) must ensure that workplaces are without risks to health and safety. This includes ensuring that atmospheric testing is conducted where there are risks from hazardous atmospheres.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Part 2 (Duties). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

Relevant safety information can come from:
- **Legislation** - WHS Acts and Regulations
- **Australian standards** - Technical specifications
- **Manufacturer's specifications and instructions**
- **Organisational procedures and policies**

---

#### 1.2.1 Organisational Procedures and Policies

Organisational procedures and policies that support safety could include:
- Work permit systems
- Safety, hazards and hazard control
- Incident, fire and accident procedures
- PPE requirements
- Organisation standard operating procedures (SOPs)

Prior to conducting gas testing, ensure that you are familiar with all safety requirements and procedures that apply to the task.

---

## 2. DETERMINE ATMOSPHERE TO BE TESTED

### 2.1 When Atmospheric Testing is Required

Atmospheric readings are taken when it is suspected that atmospheric conditions may incapacitate or injure a person, or when exposure to the atmosphere may lead to illness or death.

**Confined Spaces - Legal Requirement:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that, before a worker enters a confined space at a workplace, the atmosphere in the confined space is tested by a competent person to determine whether the space is safe for entry."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 68 (Testing atmosphere). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

These conditions may develop in areas including:
- Confined spaces
- Enclosed and partially enclosed spaces
- Hot work areas
- Storage tanks, silos, pits, pipes, shafts, ducts, transport vehicles and ships
- Open areas

If there is any doubt about the safe completion of tasks and activities due to atmospheric conditions, it is necessary to test for:
- **Oxygen content**
- **Airborne concentration of flammable contaminants**
- **Airborne concentration of potentially harmful contaminants** (e.g. hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide, methylene chloride)

Testing the atmosphere for gases is a routine part of the risk management process. Testing needs to be carried out by a competent person using a suitable, correctly calibrated gas detector.

---

### 2.2 Testing and Work Permits

Entry to some areas is determined and monitored through the use of work permits. The issuing of and complying with work permits can involve testing the spaces and atmospheres to be worked in.

**Confined Space Work Permits:**

> "Before a worker enters a confined space at a workplace, the person conducting a business or undertaking must implement the control measures to manage the risks associated with the work including, if appropriate, a permit system."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 7.2: Permits). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

If you are responsible for issuing work permits, it may be necessary to conduct atmospheric testing. The results may be used to determine:
- The type of permit required
- PPE requirements (e.g. breathing apparatus, masks)
- The requirements for atmosphere testing to be carried out as part of the permitted work

A work permit will list the required atmospheric testing which may include testing prior to starting work, testing to monitor the atmosphere during work, and/or testing at the completion of work activities.

---

### 2.3 Hazardous Atmospheres

Some of the hazardous atmospheres that must be tested to ensure safe levels are:

| Atmosphere Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Combustible/Flammable Atmospheres** | Combustible or flammable atmospheres are those that contain enough flammable gases and oxygen to support a fire or cause an explosion. |
| **Toxic Atmospheres** | Toxic atmospheres are those where any substances are present in high enough concentrations to cause illness, injury or death. |
| **Irritant/Corrosive Atmospheres** | Irritant or corrosive atmospheres are either primary or secondary. Primary irritants have limited effects on the entire system or body. A secondary irritant atmosphere could have systemic effects on the body. |
| **Asphyxiating Atmospheres** | Asphyxiating atmospheres are where oxygen is below concentration levels capable of supporting life (oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5% are considered safe). |

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 4.2: Atmospheric hazards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

---

#### 2.3.1 Explosive Range

The Explosive Range is the range of concentrations where a substance may be explosive.

Different substances will need concentration levels in a determined range to become explosive. If the level is higher than the designated range, referred to as the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL), or lower than the designated range, the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL), the explosive range has been breached.

**Upper Explosive Limit (UEL):**
The UEL is the concentration of flammable gas or vapour in the air, above which an explosive atmosphere does not form.

**Lower Explosive Limit (LEL):**
The LEL is the concentration of a flammable gas or vapour in air below which the propagation or spreading of a flame does not occur on contact with an ignition source (spark, open flame).

**Flammable Atmosphere Requirements:**

> "The concentration of flammable gas or vapour in the atmosphere of a confined space must not exceed 5% of the LEL for the gas or vapour."

## 3. SELECT AND CALIBRATE EQUIPMENT

### 3.1 Equipment Selection

Once you have determined the need for atmospheric testing and monitoring, it is essential to select the correct equipment to measure the possible contaminants.

When selecting the equipment, you should refer to documents such as:
- Policies and procedures for organisational requirements
- Surveys or geological data to determine the possible contaminants
- Legislative or regulatory requirements

You may also need to consult with relevant personnel such as:
- Safety officers
- Team members
- Other designated personnel

Always select the equipment that is going to be most effective in the conditions.

---

### 3.2 Testing and Monitoring Equipment

Testing and monitoring equipment will vary depending upon the suspected substances and contaminants in the atmosphere.

The equipment that you select and use may include:
- **Radiation detectors**
- **Sampling tubes and pumps**
- **Oxygen level meters**
- **Carbon monoxide detectors**
- **Combustible gas detectors**

The detectors to be used will depend upon the resources within your organisation. Some of the detectors will be fixed or fitted to high-risk locations while other detectors will be portable.

Each site should have a combination of fixed and portable detection equipment that allows them to best manage the testing requirements for their individual environmental conditions.

---

#### 3.2.1 Oxygen Level Meters

In order to maintain a breathable atmosphere, oxygen should be between 19.5% and 23.5%.

- A reading of 23.5% or higher means an increased risk of fire or explosion (referred to as oxygen enrichment)
- A reading lower than 19.5% increases the risk of oxygen deprivation

**Safe Oxygen Levels:**

> "The oxygen level in the atmosphere of a confined space must be within the range of 19.5% to 23.5% by volume under normal atmospheric pressure."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 74 (Conditions for entry). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

---

#### 3.2.2 Carbon Monoxide Detectors

Carbon monoxide needs to be monitored closely as it is odourless, colourless and tasteless, but is poisonous.

Most multi-gas detectors detect carbon monoxide. However, your organisation may use a specific carbon monoxide detector.

**Carbon Monoxide Hazard:**

Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that can cause death even at low concentrations. Exposure standards for carbon monoxide are set by Safe Work Australia and must not be exceeded.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2022). Model Code of Practice: Managing risks of hazardous chemicals in the workplace (Appendix 1: Workplace exposure standards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risks-hazardous-chemicals-workplace

---

#### 3.2.3 Combustible Gas Detectors

Combustible gas detectors can be single gas detectors or multi-gas detectors. Many groups are moving to multi-gas detectors to limit the amount of equipment that needs to be carried and used.

---

### 3.3 Calibrate Equipment

The equipment used will need to be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications.

Instructions for calibration must be specific to the equipment being used. You should consult the operator's manuals for instructions on calibrating the specific equipment that you are using.

The frequency of calibration depends on the reasons for conducting the testing and how often the equipment is used. Your organisation's procedures should detail the required frequency of calibration.

---

#### 3.3.1 Function Tests

Function (or bump) tests are a simple check where a test gas is used to trigger the alarm mode and demonstrate overall operation of the equipment. It is a good idea to conduct these tests every day the equipment is used.

Information on how to complete these should be included in your organisation's procedures or the manufacturer's specifications.

---

## 4. DETERMINE A TESTING REGIME

Testing regimes are used to ensure the correct readings are taken in the correct order and at the correct intervals. Workplace policies and procedures or task instructions should provide details of the required testing regime and sampling pattern.

Testing regimes and sampling patterns are determined by a combination of the following:
- Testing equipment requirements
- Legislative and regulatory requirements
- Codes of practice, Australian standards and organisational policies and procedures
- Types of contaminants found or expected
- Activities and tasks being undertaken
- Other site-specific factors

Sampling patterns are used to determine the locations where testing should occur.

**Testing Requirements:**

> "The atmosphere must be tested in a sufficient number of locations to accurately determine the atmospheric conditions throughout the space, including at different levels."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 7.1: Testing the atmosphere). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

Testing regimes and sampling patterns should be used to ensure tests are done in a timely manner and in the correct locations.

Always remember, be prepared to undertake additional testing outside of the sampling pattern and testing regime if you feel it is the safest option.

---

## 5. IDENTIFY HAZARDS

### 5.1 Hazard Identification

The identification of workplace hazards is essential to the safety of all personnel on the worksite.

**Definition:** A hazard is anything that has the potential to cause injury, illness or harm to a person.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.1: Identifying hazards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

When checking for hazards, look:
- **Up high** above your head
- **All around** you at eye level
- **Down low** on the ground (and underground services)

Each site and situation will have its own risks and hazards. By identifying all hazards within the workplace, you are able to develop effective controls to manage them.

---

### 5.2 Hazardous Materials and Toxic Substances

Many toxic substances are commonly encountered in industry. The presence of toxic substances may be due to materials being stored or used, the work being performed, or may be generated by natural processes.

Exposure to toxic substances can produce disease, bodily injury, or death in unprotected workers.

**Common gases or substances you will be monitoring for include:**

**Chemical Asphyxiates:**
- Hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and hydrogen sulphide

**Irritants and Corrosives:**
- Chlorine, ammonia, and acid bases

**Flammable Gases:**
- Acetylene, petroleum, methane, ethane, propane, and butane

**Narcotics:**
- Can be explosive as well as cause respiratory issues

**Workplace Exposure Standards:**

Safe Work Australia publishes Workplace Exposure Standards (WES) for airborne contaminants. These are concentration levels that represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse health effects.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2022). Model Code of Practice: Managing risks of hazardous chemicals in the workplace (Appendix 1: Workplace exposure standards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risks-hazardous-chemicals-workplace

---

### 5.3 Causes of Harmful Atmospheres

A workplace atmosphere may be hazardous before work commences, or may become hazardous due to the work activities and tasks being conducted in the environment.

The potential for the atmosphere to change is why all atmospheres will need to be monitored closely.

Harmful atmospheres may arise from:

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| The substance stored in the space or its by-products | The build-up of hydrogen sulphide in sewers and pits. The release of toxic substances, such as hydrogen sulphide, in a tank of decomposing organic material, especially when the material is disturbed. |
| The work performed in the space | The use of paints, adhesives, solvents or cleaning solutions. Welding or brazing with metals capable of producing toxic fumes. Exhaust fumes from engines used in the space. |
| The entry of natural contaminants from surrounding land | Acid groundwater acting on limestone can lead to dangerous accumulations of carbon dioxide. Methane can be released from groundwater and from decay of organic matter. |
| The release of atmospheric contaminants | When sludge, slurry or other deposits are disturbed or when scale is removed. |
| The manufacturing process | Residues left in tanks, vessels etc., or remaining on internal surfaces, which can give off gas or vapour. |
| The entry and accumulation of gases from adjacent plant | The contamination of underground confined spaces by substances from plant many metres away. Carbon monoxide from the exhaust of LPG-powered forklifts operating in or close to the confined space. |

## 6. APPLY HAZARD CONTROL MEASURES

### 6.1 Hierarchy of Hazard Control

Once hazards and risks have been identified, analysed and evaluated, hazard control measures need to be considered and applied.

The best way to control hazards is to use the Hierarchy of Hazard Control. The Hierarchy of Hazard Control is the name given to a range of control methods used to eliminate or control hazards and risks in the workplace.

| Hierarchy Level | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **1. Elimination** | Completely remove the hazard. This is the best kind of hazard control. |
| **2. Substitution** | Swap a dangerous work method or situation for one that is less dangerous. |
| **3. Isolation** | Isolate or restrict access to the hazard. |
| **4. Engineering Controls** | Use equipment to lower the risk level. |
| **5. Administrative Controls** | Site rules and policies attempt to control a hazard. |
| **6. Personal Protective Equipment** | The least effective control. Use PPE while you carry out your work. |

**Legal Requirement:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must manage risks to health and safety in accordance with Part 3.1 [of the Regulations]. This includes eliminating risks so far as is reasonably practicable, or if not, minimising those risks so far as is reasonably practicable."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.3: Controlling risks). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

Hazard control measures need to be put in place before you start your work, or as soon as you see a hazard while you are doing your work.

Talk to your supervisor or safety officer if you are not sure if it is safe enough to carry out your work. If you think the hazard is still too dangerous you should not try to do the work.

---

### 6.2 Personal Protective Equipment

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is clothing and equipment designed to lower the chance of you being hurt on the job. It is required to enter most work sites. The required PPE should be listed in your organisational procedures.

**PPE Legal Requirement:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that personal protective equipment is selected having regard to the nature of the work and the hazard."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 44 (Selection of personal protective equipment). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

PPE can include:
- Head protection - hard hats and helmets
- Foot protection - non-slip work boots
- Hand protection - gloves
- Eye protection - goggles, visors or glasses
- Ear protection - plugs or muffs
- Breathing protection - masks or respirators
- Chemical protective equipment - HAZMAT clothing
- Hi-visibility clothing
- Weather protection

**For Hazardous Atmospheres:**

Where atmospheric hazards cannot be adequately controlled, workers must use appropriate respiratory protective equipment such as air-supplied breathing apparatus.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 6.2: Respiratory protective equipment). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

---

## 7. TESTING ATMOSPHERES

### 7.1 Conduct Sampling

Initial testing needs to be done from outside of the hazardous atmosphere by inserting a sample probe at appropriately selected access holes, nozzles and openings.

All tests need to be completed in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and directions for the equipment used.

Follow the required testing regime or sampling pattern.

**Testing from Outside:**

> "Before a worker enters a confined space, the atmosphere must be tested from outside the space, or the worker must wear appropriate respiratory protective equipment."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 7.1: Testing the atmosphere). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

As it is possible for contaminants to settle at different levels, the top, middle and bottom of the space needs to be tested.

For example:
- Some gases (such as hydrogen sulphide) are heavier than air and in unventilated areas will settle to the bottom of the space
- Other gases (such as methane) are lighter than air and will collect at the top of the space

Tests need to be made at a sufficient number of points to accurately reflect areas of the space that are likely to be accessed.

---

#### 7.1.1 Liquids in a Confined Space

Any liquids should be pumped out of a confined space and liquid flow diverted from the space before testing for toxic gases is carried out.

If the liquid cannot be removed then it should be stirred as vigorously as possible while testing takes place. The stirring should be mechanical using a stirrer or pump or by blowing compressed air through the bottom of the space.

Stirring the liquid manually with a paddle will not give sufficient agitation to release the trapped gases.

---

## 8. INTERPRET AND REPORT READINGS

### 8.1 Understanding Results

Once readings of contaminants are taken, the results must be interpreted and analysed, as well as recorded.

Readings may also be compared with appropriate specifications and exposure limits.

Each item of testing equipment will have different methods of reading results. You must be aware of how these results are to be read.

Analysis of readings should not be taken in isolation. You may be required to compare the combined readings and effects to determine how substances may interact with each other.

---

### 8.2 Contaminant Units of Measurement

How a unit of contaminant is expressed depends upon the type of contaminant.

For example:
- Gases such as oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide are expressed as a **percentage (%)** of atmosphere or **Volume in Volume (v/v)**
- Irritants may be expressed as **Parts per Million (PPM)** or **milligrams per cubic metre (mg/m³)**

Each contaminant that may be present could have different methods of expressing its concentration depending upon the equipment used to take the measurements, the composition of the samples and the organisational requirements.

---

### 8.3 Exposure Standards

Exposure standards are guidelines regarding the concentrations of individual chemical substances that should not impair health to workers.

Exposure standards can be measured or expressed in the following ways:

| Exposure Standard | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Time Weighted Average (TWA)** | TWA measure the exposure to contaminants over a set period of time, usually 8 hours. This ensures that you can be safely exposed to a chemical over a certain period of time, as long as the exposure does not exceed the specified amount. |
| **Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL)** | The STEL may be higher than the eight hour TWA. It is the maximum average concentration to which an unprotected worker may be exposed in any fifteen-minute interval during the day. |
| **Peak Limitation Values** | Peak limitation values relate to the maximum concentration of a contaminant that must not be exceeded. Anything that is past the maximum concentration point should be considered to be toxic. |

**Workplace Exposure Standards:**

> "The exposure standard for a substance is the airborne concentration of that substance which, according to current knowledge, should neither impair the health of, nor cause undue discomfort to, nearly all workers."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2022). Model Code of Practice: Managing risks of hazardous chemicals in the workplace (Section 8.1: Exposure standards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risks-hazardous-chemicals-workplace

Unprotected workers must not be exposed to levels of toxic contaminants that exceed Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) concentrations.

---

#### 8.3.1 Acute and Chronic Effects of Toxic Substances

The toxic effect on humans from contaminants is dependent upon:
- The concentration of the contaminant
- The mix or number of other contaminants
- Unprotected exposure times to the contaminants
- The base level of background environmental contamination

Airborne toxic substances are typically classified on the basis of their ability to produce physiological effects on exposed workers. Toxic substances tend to produce symptoms in two time frames:

1. Higher levels of exposure tend to produce **immediate effects (acute)**
2. Lower levels of long-term exposure (**chronic**) may not produce physiological symptoms for years

Each organisation will have a list of compounds and the concentrations at which they become toxic or hazardous. This list will generally be located with the measuring equipment, and must be present whenever readings are taken.

---

### 8.4 Report Results

Upon completion of the analysis and comparison of readings, it is necessary to report the results to your commanding officer, management team, team leader or other designated personnel.

Results will normally be communicated verbally, either in a face-to-face situation or using an appropriate communication system.

A written report will then also be passed on to appropriate personnel.

When atmospheric readings reach a hazardous or dangerous level, the technician who is operating the equipment will need to communicate these results immediately in accordance with the operational requirements for the organisation.

---

#### 8.4.1 Recommending Actions

An atmosphere becomes hazardous when it is unable to adequately support life, could induce an injury or illness, or poses a threat of further dangers such as explosions.

If you realise the atmosphere has become dangerous, you will need to immediately make recommendations to the people operating in the atmosphere.

These recommendations should always ensure the safety of the workers first. Follow your procedures and training as well as drawing on your previous experience.

**Unsafe Atmosphere Actions:**

> "If testing shows that the atmosphere does not meet the conditions for safe entry, workers must not enter unless they are wearing appropriate respiratory protective equipment and other necessary PPE."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2011). Model Code of Practice: Confined spaces (Section 7.1: Testing the atmosphere). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-confined-spaces

---

## 9. CONDUCT ONGOING MONITORING

If there is any reason to suspect that the atmosphere or conditions faced during operations may alter, the atmosphere should be monitored on an ongoing basis.

If monitoring is required it should be conducted:
- At intervals, depending on changing conditions
- No less frequently than hourly
- Continuously, until the job is completed
- At any change in conditions while completing the tasks
- As specified by organisational procedures
- As required by the tasks and activities being undertaken
- At other designated occasions

**Continuous Monitoring Requirement:**

> "A confined space must be continually monitored while work is being carried out if: (a) the concentration of flammable gas or vapour in the space is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10% of its lower explosive limit; or (b) the work being carried out may cause the atmospheric conditions in the space to become unsafe."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 75 (Monitoring atmosphere). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

Re-testing and continuous monitoring of the atmosphere may be necessary due to the work being done or the disturbance of hazardous material, such as sludge.

Each worker may also wear a continuous monitoring device. The device should be capable of sounding an alarm if dangerous gas levels or oxygen deficiency develop.

---

## 10. TAKE ACTION IF READINGS POSE AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK

### 10.1 Immediate Actions

If any readings pose an unacceptable risk to workers or those in the area, you will need to take appropriate action in accordance with workplace requirements and environmental conditions.

Common actions could include:
- Reporting the readings to relevant personnel
- Purging the atmosphere
- Evacuation of personnel
- Stopping actions and activities and allowing the atmosphere to clear by itself
- Adapting PPE requirements
- Other site-specific requirements

Care should be taken to prevent people outside an area from being exposed to gas while the atmosphere inside the area is being purged. Care must also be taken when purging flammable gases.

**Important:** Do not use pure oxygen or gases with a higher oxygen level than 21% for purging purposes.

---

### 10.2 Ventilation and Purging

**Ventilation Requirements:**

> "A confined space must be ventilated to ensure that the concentration of oxygen and any harmful airborne contaminant is maintained at a safe level while work is being carried out in the space."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 73 (Ventilation). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

Ventilation such as exhaust fans can be used to remove hazardous gases and contaminants. Any purging of a confined space needs to be followed up with proper ventilation procedures.

Alternatively, people can enter the area if they wear an approved air-supplied respirator (self-contained breathing apparatus), so long as there are no flammable gases present.

---

### 10.3 Using Purging Agents

Purging agents are those substances that are used to remove (purge) contaminants from an area. Each contaminant will have a purging agent that works best.

Purging agents should never oxygen enrich the atmosphere, therefore never use a gas or agent that has oxygen content higher than 21%.

The purging agent used will depend upon the contaminants you are dealing with and the designated processes and protocols for your organisation.

Actions taken on unacceptable test results and readings must follow workplace and organisational procedures, with care being taken to not contaminate the environment.

At all times, keep your management team informed of what actions you are taking and why they are necessary.

---

## 11. MAINTAIN GAS TESTING EQUIPMENT

### 11.1 Maintenance Procedures

After use, each item of gas testing equipment will need to be maintained in accordance with the organisational procedures and manufacturer's specifications.

It is important that the equipment is maintained in a clean and operationally ready state to ensure accurate readings when the equipment is next used.

Common maintenance procedures for gas testing equipment will include:
- Cleaning
- Inspection and reporting of faults
- Replacement of parts
- Recalibration of equipment
- Storage of equipment

---

### 11.2 Cleaning

Information about cleaning each component of the testing and monitoring equipment will be found in the procedural and operator's manuals.

For example, infrared gas detectors may need to have the lens cleaned if it becomes dirty.

Ensure that the steps are followed accurately, and that you take any necessary safety precautions.

---

### 11.3 Inspection and Fault Finding

It is necessary for all testing and monitoring equipment to be inspected and tested to identify any faults or damage.

Inspecting the equipment may include checking over the equipment structurally for damage, and conducting appropriate testing procedures.

Any testing procedures taking place will need to be conducted according to the manufacturer's specifications and recommendations. These specifications will be found in the operator's manual for each individual piece of equipment.

If any items of testing equipment are faulty or damaged, you will need to report these faults in accordance with your workplace requirements. At all times, ensure you isolate the faulty equipment to ensure it is not used again until the fault has been rectified and the item returned to use.

---

### 11.4 Replacement or Recalibration

Some gas detectors require routine replacement of cartridges to keep them in proper working order. Batteries may need to be recharged or replaced.

Refer to the manufacturer's operating manual for the steps to be followed when replacing parts or recalibrating testing and monitoring equipment.

---

### 11.5 Storing Equipment

Testing and monitoring equipment must be stored in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and workplace requirements to ensure it is fit for use when next needed.

By returning the equipment to the required location you are ensuring the item is able to be found when it is next needed.

All equipment must be returned to the appropriate and designated storage location in the condition required by the manufacturer.

---

## 12. MAINTAIN RECORDS

### 12.1 Record Keeping Requirements

Every organisation will have procedures to ensure every test conducted and result received is linked to each other, and then linked to a testing and monitoring event.

**Legal Requirement for Records:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking at a workplace must keep a record of atmospheric testing conducted in relation to a confined space at the workplace. The record must include the date, time and results of the test, and the name of the person who conducted the test."

Each organisation will have defined procedures which will outline what information needs to be recorded, where it needs to be recorded and when it needs to be recorded.

It is essential that you understand the reporting, documentation and maintenance requirements for your organisation.
