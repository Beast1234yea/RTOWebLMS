- **Trailer configuration** - Semi-trailer or dog trailer configurations
- **Capacity** - Typically 20-40 cubic metres
- **Advantages** - Faster unloading, better load distribution, reduced cycle times

**Common Applications in Resources & Infrastructure:**
- Mining overburden and waste rock haulage
- Quarry aggregate transport
- Road construction material distribution
- Dam and embankment construction
- Tailings placement

**SWMS Components:**

A compliant SWMS must include:
1. Company and project details
2. Description of the high risk construction work
3. Identified hazards arising from the work
4. Control measures to eliminate or minimize risks
5. Person responsible for implementing control measures
6. Consultation with workers

## 4. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL

### 4.1 Identify Hazards

**Definition:** A hazard is anything with the potential to cause harm to people, property, or the environment.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.1: Identifying hazards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

**Common Hazards for Belly Dump Truck Operations:**

**Mobile Plant Hazards:**
- Collision with other vehicles, plant or pedestrians
- Rollover on unstable ground or slopes
- Being struck by materials or falling objects
- Entanglement with moving parts
- Fire and explosion
- Noise exposure
- Whole body vibration
- Manual handling injuries

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Weather conditions (rain, fog, heat, cold)
- Poor visibility and lighting
- Dust generation
- Rough or uneven terrain
- Steep gradients and haul road conditions
- Underground/overhead services

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2016). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risks of plant in the workplace (Section 3.2.7: Mobile plant - Hazards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risks-plant-workplace

---

### 4.2 Risk Assessment

After identifying hazards, you must assess the level of risk by considering:

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Likelihood** - How likely is it that someone will be harmed?
2. **Severity** - How serious would the injury or harm be?
3. **Exposure** - How many people could be affected?

**Risk Matrix:**

| Likelihood | Consequence | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Almost Certain | Catastrophic | Extreme Risk |
| Likely | Major | High Risk |
| Possible | Moderate | Medium Risk |
| Unlikely | Minor | Low Risk |
| Rare | Insignificant | Very Low Risk |

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.2: Assessing risks). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

---

### 4.3 Control Hazards - Hierarchy of Control

**The Hierarchy of Control is the preferred method for controlling risks in Australian workplaces.**

The hierarchy ranks risk control measures from highest to lowest level of protection and reliability:

| Level | Control Type | Action | Example for Belly Dump Trucks |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **1** | **Elimination** | Completely remove the hazard | Eliminate need to reverse by designing one-way traffic loops |
| **2** | **Substitution** | Swap for something less hazardous | Use automated load tracking instead of manual recording |
| **3** | **Isolation** | Separate people from the hazard | Use designated haul roads separate from light vehicles |
| **4** | **Engineering Controls** | Use equipment to control the risk | Install reversing cameras, proximity detection systems |
| **5** | **Administrative Controls** | Safe work procedures and training | Traffic management plans, speed limits, competency training |
| **6** | **PPE** | Personal protective equipment | Seatbelts, high-visibility clothing, hearing protection |

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.3: Controlling risks). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

**Important Note:** Elimination is the most effective control. PPE is the least effective and should only be used when higher-level controls are not reasonably practicable.

---

### 4.4 Mobile Plant Specific Controls

**Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS):**

> "Powered mobile plant that has a risk of rollover must be fitted with a rollover protective structure unless it is not reasonably practicable to fit the structure."

**Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS):**

> "Powered mobile plant must be fitted with a falling object protective structure if there is a risk of an object falling on the plant and injuring the operator."

**Operator Restraints (Seatbelts):**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that powered mobile plant is fitted with a suitable operator restraint if the plant is fitted with a rollover protective structure or a falling object protective structure."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulations 215-217 (Protective structures and operator restraints). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**Critical Safety Rule:** Always wear your seatbelt when operating mobile plant fitted with ROPS/FOPS.

- Check load is stable before moving

**Source:** Australian Government. (2025). RIIMPO336E Element 2. training.gov.au. Retrieved November 2025, from https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/RIIMPO336E

**Loading Safety:**

✓ **Communication** - Maintain constant communication with loader operator

✓ **Avoid overloading** - Do not exceed gross vehicle mass (GVM)
✓ **Avoid side loading** - Loading from side can cause rollover
✓ **Spillage** - Keep load within trailer confines
✓ **Clear area** - Wait for loader to clear before moving

**Load Capacity:**

Every belly dump truck has a rated capacity that must not be exceeded:

- Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM)
- Gross Combination Mass (GCM)
- Axle load limits
- Payload capacity

Exceeding capacity can cause:
- Brake failure

- Compliance with legal axle weights

**Center of Gravity:**

Loaded belly dump trucks have a high center of gravity. This increases rollover risk when:
- Taking corners too fast
- Operating on side slopes
- Wheel drops off edge
- Sudden steering inputs

**Safe cornering:**
- Reduce speed before corners
- Smooth steering inputs
- Wider turning path when loaded
- Be aware of trailer offtracking

---

### 7.3 Unloading Operations

**Unloading Site Requirements:**

Before unloading, verify:

✓ Level, stable ground
✓ Sufficient width and space
✓ No overhead hazards (powerlines, structures)
✓ No underground services in dump area
✓ Ground bearing capacity adequate
✓ Clear of other vehicles and personnel
✓ Designated dump location confirmed

**Unloading Procedure:**

1. Position truck perpendicular to dump edge (if applicable)
2. Apply park brake
3. Check area clear of personnel
4. Open dump gates using hydraulic controls
5. Drive forward slowly as material discharges
6. Monitor material flow in mirrors
7. Stop when fully unloaded
8. Close and latch dump gates
9. Move clear of dump area

**Critical Safety Points:**

⚠ **Never discharge load with people nearby**
⚠ **Never exit cab with gates open**
⚠ **Never travel with gates unlocked**
⚠ **Be aware of tip head edges**
⚠ **Do not dump on unstable ground**
⚠ **Check gates fully closed before driving**
