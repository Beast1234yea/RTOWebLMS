- Tractor and dump body mounted on single chassis
- No articulation point
- Conventional steering (front wheels only)
- Rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive
- Very large payload capacity (90-400+ tonnes)

**Key Features:**
- **Massive size** - Among largest mobile equipment
- **Dual rear axles** - Superior load distribution
- **High ground clearance** - For rough terrain
- **Diesel-electric drive** - Many ultra-class trucks
- **Autonomous capable** - Latest models support automation
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - Payload, tyre pressure, temperatures
- **ROPS/FOPS cabin** - Full rollover and falling object protection

**Common Applications:**
- Open-pit mine ore haulage
- Overburden and waste rock removal
- Large-scale quarrying operations
- Major civil engineering projects

- **Extended braking** - Plan stops well in advance
- **Reduced maneuverability** - Wider turns required
- **Lower ground clearance** - More likely to bottom out
- **Increased tire loads** - Monitor TPMS

**Grade Climbing:**

✓ Maintain momentum where safe
