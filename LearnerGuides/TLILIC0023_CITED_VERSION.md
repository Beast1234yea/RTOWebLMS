## 3. MOBILE CRANE OPERATING SYSTEMS

### 3.1 Understanding Rated Capacity

**Rated capacity is the maximum safe working load (SWL) under specified conditions.**

**Factors affecting capacity:**

✓ **Boom length** - Longer boom = reduced capacity
✓ **Boom angle** - Steeper angle (higher) = reduced capacity
✓ **Load radius** - Distance from crane centerline to load center
✓ **Outrigger extension** - Affects stability and weight distribution
✓ **Ground conditions** - Must support crane weight plus load

**Capacity Plate:**

Every crane has a capacity plate (or data plate) permanently fixed to the cab. It specifies:
- Manufacturer name and model
- Serial number
- Maximum load capacity
- Boom configurations
- Outrigger positions
- Date of manufacture

**Critical Safety Rule:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that a load does not exceed the rated capacity of the equipment used to lift the load."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 40 (Safe use of plant). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

---

### 3.2 Load Charts and Capacity Tables

**Load charts provide detailed capacity information.**

**Load chart components:**

- **Boom length** - Specified in metres
- **Radius columns** - Capacity at various distances from crane
- **Boom angle rows** - Different jib elevations
- **Capacity table** - Maximum load in tonnes at each configuration
- **Outrigger notes** - Special configurations or restrictions

**Using load charts:**

1. Determine load weight (must be verified)
2. Determine lift radius (horizontal distance)
3. Determine boom angle (jib elevation)
4. Cross-reference on load chart
5. Compare load to capacity
6. Do not exceed capacity shown

**Example:**
```
Load: 25 tonnes
Radius: 15 metres
Boom angle: 70°

From load chart: Capacity at 15m, 70° = 30 tonnes
Result: SAFE - Load (25 tonnes) < Capacity (30 tonnes)
```

**Load charts are binding. Never exceed the chart limits.**

**Source:** TLILIC0023 Element 3 - Load verification - training.gov.au

---

### 5.2 Load Planning Process

**Comprehensive planning ensures safe lifts.**

**Pre-lift Planning Steps:**

1. **Define the load:**
   - Weight (verified)
   - Dimensions (height, width, depth)
   - Center of gravity location
   - Special characteristics (fragile, hazardous, etc.)

2. **Assess the work area:**
   - Space available for crane positioning
   - Ground bearing capacity
   - Overhead obstacles and clearances
   - Underground utilities (electrical, gas, water)
   - Personnel and public access areas

3. **Select the crane:**
   - Verify capacity for planned load
   - Confirm boom length and reach
   - Check stability calculations
   - Confirm safety margin (typically 1.25×)

4. **Determine rigging:**
   - Select sling type and size
   - Calculate sling tensions and angles
   - Design load attachment points
   - Plan for load balance

5. **Identify hazards:**
   - Load-related hazards (falling load, swing)
   - Environmental hazards (weather, obstacles)
   - Personnel hazards (access, communication)
   - Crane hazards (failure, malfunction)

6. **Develop controls:**
   - Use hierarchy of control
   - Assign personnel roles
   - Establish communication procedures
   - Plan exclusion zones
   - Create contingency plans

### 5.3 Capacity Calculations

**Load moment calculations determine if a lift is safe.**

**Load Moment Formula:**

```
Load Moment = Load Weight (tonnes) × Radius (metres)
```

**Verification:**

```
If Load Moment ≤ Crane Capacity at that radius and boom angle
Then lift is SAFE

If Load Moment > Crane Capacity
Then lift is UNSAFE - do not proceed
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Load weight: 40 tonnes (verified)
Load radius: 12 metres (horizontal distance)
Boom angle: 65° (jib elevation)

Load Moment = 40 × 12 = 480 tonne·metres

From load chart at 12m radius, 65° angle:
Crane capacity = 550 tonne·metres

Result: SAFE (480 < 550)
Safety factor: 1.15 (acceptable, typically 1.25+)
```

**Calculations must be accurate and documented for compliance.**

## 6. SAFE RIGGING AND LIFTING TECHNIQUES

### 6.1 Rigging Hardware Inspection

**All rigging hardware must be inspected before every use.**

**Wire Rope Slings:**
- Check for broken wires (6 wires broken in one strand or 9 broken in a lay = replace)
- Look for kinks or permanent deformation
- Inspect for corrosion or rust
- Check end fittings (eyes) for damage
- Verify eye is properly formed (not tyre welded)

**Synthetic Slings:**
- Check for cuts or punctures (especially UV damage)
- Look for burns or melting
- Verify stitching intact
- Check label and certification tag
- Ensure current inspection date

**Chain Slings:**
- Inspect each link for cracks or bending
- Look for twisted links or binding
- Check for corrosion or fatigue failure
- Verify shortener and fittings secure
- Confirm alloy grade (usually Grade 8)

**Attachment Hardware:**
- Shackles: No cracks, bent pins, missing cotter pins
- Hooks: No cracks, bent or damaged (test hook opening)
- Swivels: Smooth rotation, no binding or stiction
- Spreader bars: Aligned, not bent, secure connections

**Certification:**
- Current inspection tag visible (typically annual)

### 6.2 Rigging Principles for Balanced Loads

**Proper rigging ensures safe load control.**

**Four-Point Rigging:**
- Distribute load across minimum 4 attachment points
- Reduces stress on individual points
- Improves load stability
- Prevents rotation during lift

**Sling Angle Optimization:**

The angle between slings affects load distribution:

| Sling Angle | Load per Sling | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| 90° (vertical) | 1.0 × load | Best case, preferred |
| 75° | 1.04 × load | Very good |
| 60° | 1.15 × load | Acceptable |
| 45° | 1.41 × load | Increases stress significantly |
| 30° | 1.93 × load | High stress, avoid |

**Avoid shallow angles (less than 45°). Steeper angles reduce sling tension and are safer.**

**Center of Gravity:**
- Load must be balanced to hang plumb (vertically)
- Rigging must be symmetrical
- Load should not rotate during lift
- Suspension points must support balanced configuration

**Rigging Attachments:**
- Use spreader bars to distribute load evenly
- Protect edges with softeners (rope, fabric, etc.)
- Use tag lines to control load movement
- Plan load attachment before rigging

---

### 6.3 Safe Lifting Procedure

**Step-by-step safe lifting operation:**

**Pre-Lift:**
1. Verify load weight and center of gravity
2. Confirm rigging selection and inspection
3. Calculate load moment and verify capacity
4. Check weather (wind speed within limits)
5. Brief all personnel on lift plan
6. Establish communication procedures
7. Clear area of unnecessary personnel

**Lift Execution:**
1. Sound alert signal (horn, bell, etc.)
2. Clear exclusion zone - all personnel outside
3. Perform test lift (raise load 30-50cm)
4. Pause and observe:
   - Load balanced (not rotating)
   - Rigging intact (no slipping)
   - Crane responding properly
   - Communication intact
5. Stop and lower if unsafe - investigate before retry
6. Progressive lift - smooth, steady upward movement
7. Monitor continuously - operator and signaller watch
8. Controlled movement - avoid rapid direction changes
9. Clear obstacles - maintain safe clearances
10. Approach load slowly to landing area
11. Lower gently onto supports
12. Ensure load secure - lower hook slowly
13. Disconnect rigging only when safe

**Post-Lift:**
1. Remove all slings and rigging
2. Lower hook to safe position
3. Return area to normal
4. Document lift details if required
5. Report any issues or near-misses

---

### 7.2 Risk Assessment and Control Hierarchy

**Risk assessment determines what controls are needed.**

**Risk Assessment Process:**

1. **Identify hazard** - What could cause harm?
2. **Identify people at risk** - Who could be affected?
3. **Assess likelihood** - How likely is this to occur?
4. **Assess severity** - How serious would injury be?
5. **Evaluate current controls** - Are existing controls adequate?
6. **Determine if acceptable** - Is risk ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)?
7. **Design additional controls** - If risk not acceptable
8. **Implement controls** - Put them in place
9. **Review effectiveness** - Check controls are working

**Hierarchy of Control:**

| Level | Type | Action | Example |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Elimination | Remove hazard entirely | Avoid lift, use alternative method |
| 2 | Substitution | Replace with less hazardous option | Use smaller crane, multiple smaller lifts |
| 3 | Isolation | Restrict access to hazard | Exclusion zones, barriers |
| 4 | Engineering | Use equipment/design to control | Load limiters, anti-sway devices |
| 5 | Administrative | Rules, procedures, training | Lift plans, pre-lift briefings, permits |
| 6 | PPE | Personal protective equipment | Hard hats, high-visibility (least effective) |

**Controls are most effective when combining multiple levels.**
