## 6. LOAD HANDLING AND WORK POSITIONING

### 6.1 Load Capacity and Load Charts

**Load Capacity Plate (Data Plate):**

Every EWP has a load capacity plate that specifies:
- Maximum personnel load
- Maximum total load (personnel + equipment)
- Boom angle versus load capacity
- Outrigger positioning requirements
- Wind load limitations

**Legal Requirement:**

> "A person must not exceed the weight limits, or the manufacturer's specifications, for the plant."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Regulation 214 (Duty to not exceed weight limits). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**Reading Load Charts:**

Load charts show the relationship between:
- Boom extension/reach distance
- Boom angle (degrees from horizontal)
- Maximum safe load at that position

**Critical Principle:**
- As boom extends further, load capacity decreases
- As boom angles lower (more horizontal), load capacity may decrease
- Different load capacities apply with vs. without outrigger support
- Wind conditions reduce safe load capacity

**Source:** TLILIC0005 Element 3 - Performance Criteria 3.2-3.4: Verify loads and safe positioning, training.gov.au

### 6.2 Positioning Personnel and Equipment

**Work Platform Stability:**

Before raising the platform:

✓ **Verify ground condition:**
- Ground is level and solid
- No soft spots, water, or subsidence visible
- Adequate bearing capacity for equipment weight
- No uneven surfaces causing platform tilt

✓ **Verify outrigger positioning:**
- Outriggers extended fully
- Feet in firm contact with ground (no gaps)
- No overhead obstructions for outrigger arms
- Sufficient clearance from property edges or water

✓ **Verify load distribution:**
- Personnel and equipment positioned centrally in basket
- Load does not exceed capacity for boom angle
- Equipment is secured to prevent sliding

**Operating Angles and Heights:**

- Maintain aware of boom angle at all times
- Verify you are within capacity limits for current angle
- Do not attempt to reach beyond equipment capability
- Remember capacity decreases as boom extends
