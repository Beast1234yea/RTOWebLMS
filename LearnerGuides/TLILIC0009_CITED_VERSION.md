## 2. VEHICLE LOADING CRANE LICENSING AND CLASSIFICATION

### 2.1 What is a Vehicle Loading Crane?

**A vehicle loading crane is a crane mounted on a road vehicle (truck) that:**
- Rotates or slews to position loads
- Lifts and lowers loads for transport or placement
- Operates as an integrated vehicle-mounted system
- Has a specified rated capacity (in tonne metres)

**Capacity is measured in tonne metres (TM):**
- 1 tonne metre = lifting 1 tonne to 1 metre reach
- Example: A 20 TM crane can lift 2 tonnes at 10 metres, or 4 tonnes at 5 metres
- Capacity varies with boom length and angle

---

### 2.2 High Risk Work Classification

**Vehicle loading cranes (10 TM and above) are high-risk work equipment.**

**Regulatory Classification:**

> "Operating a vehicle loading crane with a rated capacity of 10 tonne metres or greater is classified as high-risk work under Schedule 2 of the Model WHS Regulations."

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2024). Model Work Health and Safety Regulations, Schedule 2 (VLC class high risk work). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/law-and-regulation/model-whs-laws

**License holders must:**
- Demonstrate competency in TLILIC0009
- Comply with all safety requirements
- Maintain a high-risk work licence from relevant state/territory
- Follow workplace procedures and manufacturer instructions

## 3. CRANE SYSTEMS AND LOAD MOMENT THEORY

### 3.1 Understanding Tonne Metres Capacity

**Tonne Metres (TM) is the capacity rating for vehicle loading cranes.**

**Load Moment Calculation:**

```
Load Moment (TM) = Load Weight (tonnes) × Radius (metres)
```

**Example:**
```
Load: 2 tonnes
Radius: 8 metres
Load Moment: 2 × 8 = 16 tonne metres

If crane rated capacity: 20 TM
Result: SAFE (16 TM < 20 TM capacity)
```

**Capacity varies with configuration:**
- Boom length - Longer boom = reduced capacity
- Boom angle - Higher angle = reduced capacity
- Outrigger extension - Affects stability and load distribution
- Vehicle position - Level, stable positioning required

**Load Charts:**

Every vehicle loading crane is supplied with load charts specifying capacity at various configurations. Charts typically show:
- Boom length (metres)
- Boom angle (degrees)
- Capacity (tonnes) at each radius
- Notes on outrigger deployment
- Special conditions or restrictions

**Critical Rule:**

> "A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure that a load does not exceed the rated capacity of the equipment used to lift the load."

### 3.2 Crane Safety and Monitoring Systems

**Vehicle loading cranes include safety systems:**

**Load Moment Indicator (LMI):**
- Monitors load weight and boom position
- Calculates load moment continuously
- Warns operator as capacity approaches
- Prevents overloading with mechanical limiter
- Critical safety device

**Mechanical Limiter:**
- Prevents boom movement beyond capacity
- Cannot be overridden by operator
- Automatically stops operation if overload detected
- Must not be disabled or tampered with

**Anti-Two-Block Device:**
- Prevents hook hitting boom tip
- Critical to prevent equipment failure
- Functionally tested regularly

**Anemometer (if applicable):**
- Measures wind speed
- Warns if wind exceeds safe limits
- Prevents operation in dangerous winds

**Level Indicator:**
- Confirms vehicle is level
- Affects capacity calculations
- Non-level operation reduces capacity

**Emergency Lowering System:**
- Mechanical backup if power fails
- Allows manual lowering of suspended load
- Tested monthly or per manufacturer schedule

## 4. VEHICLE STABILITY AND LOAD DISTRIBUTION

### 4.1 Vehicle Positioning and Stability

**Proper positioning is essential for safe operation.**

**Stability Requirements:**

The vehicle must be:
- Positioned on firm, level ground
- On surfaces capable of supporting vehicle weight plus lifted load
- Outriggers deployed to specified extension
- All wheels secure and brakes applied
- Engine running (for hydraulic operation)
- No movement during load handling

**Outrigger Deployment:**

Outriggers extend to the sides to:
- Increase stability margin
- Distribute load weight
- Prevent vehicle tipping
- Support specified rated capacity

**Deployment procedure:**
1. Position vehicle on level, firm ground
2. Extend outriggers to full extension (or as specified)
3. Lower outrigger pads until firm contact with ground
4. Verify all pads have firm contact
5. Confirm level indicator shows level
6. Check stability before commencing lift

**No load should be lifted if vehicle is not level or outriggers not fully deployed.**

---

### 4.2 Load Distribution and Balance

**Load balance is critical for vehicle stability and safe operation.**

**Load Positioning:**

- Load must be suspended plumb (directly below hook)
- Load must not rotate or swing
- Load must be balanced for travel (if vehicle will move with load)
- Center of gravity must be directly over vehicle centerline for transport

**Effects of Unbalanced Load:**

- Vehicle may tilt or tip
- Suspension may fail
- Steering may become difficult
- Braking effectiveness reduced
- Load may swing dangerously

**Load Securing for Transport:**

If load is to be transported by vehicle:
- Secure with lashing straps or chains
- Distribute load evenly
- Lower load completely before moving vehicle
- Follow road transport regulations
- Drive carefully and slowly

**Verification Methods (in order of preference):**

1. **Official specification** - Manufacturer's documented weight
2. **Certified weighbridge** - Professional weighing equipment
3. **Engineering calculation** - By qualified engineer using material density
4. **Previous records** - Only if load is identical to previously weighed item

**Never assume or estimate load weight.**

**For uncertain weights:**
- Always use the highest reasonable estimate
- Consider a test lift at reduced height
- Have an engineer verify if critical
- Document the verification method used

**Source:** TLILIC0009 Element 3 - Load verification - training.gov.au

---

### 6.2 Capacity Calculations and Load Charts

**Load moment calculations ensure safe operation.**

**Using Load Charts:**

1. **Determine load weight** (verified)
2. **Determine boom length** (metres)
3. **Determine boom angle** (degrees from horizontal)
4. **Read capacity from chart** at that configuration
5. **Calculate load moment** = weight × reach
6. **Verify load moment ≤ chart capacity**
7. **Do not lift if load exceeds capacity**

**Example Calculation:**

```
Load: 3 tonnes (verified)
Boom length: 8 metres
Boom angle: 50°
Reach (horizontal): 6 metres

From load chart at 8m boom, 50°:
Capacity = 4 tonnes at 6 metres reach

Load moment = 3 × 6 = 18 tonne metres
Capacity = 4 × 6 = 24 tonne metres

Result: SAFE (18 TM < 24 TM)
Safety margin: 1.33 (acceptable)
```

**Calculations must be accurate and documented.**
