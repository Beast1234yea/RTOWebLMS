### 6.3 Articulated Steering Control

**Articulation Steering Characteristics:**

Articulated haul trucks steer differently from conventional vehicles:

**Key Differences:**
- Steering occurs at center articulation point
- Front and rear both turn
- Tighter turning radius than rigid trucks
- Rear tracks inside front on turns
- Steering angle limited to prevent jackknifing
- All wheels are driven

**Safe Steering Practices:**

✓ **Smooth inputs** - Avoid sudden steering movements
✓ **Speed appropriate** - Reduce speed before turns
✓ **Load awareness** - Loaded trucks less stable in turns
✓ **Surface conditions** - Slippery surfaces increase jackknife risk
✓ **Differential lock** - Disengage for normal steering
✓ **Anticipate** - Plan steering inputs early

**Jackknife Prevention:**

Jackknifing occurs when tractor and body fold excessively, causing loss of control or rollover.

**Prevention:**
- Reduce speed on slippery surfaces
- Smooth steering inputs
- Don't brake and steer simultaneously on poor surface
- Engage differential lock on steep grades
- Understand steering angle limits

---

### 6.4 Transmission and Gear Selection

**Transmission Types:**

Most modern articulated haul trucks use automatic transmissions with:
- Multiple forward gears (typically 6-8 speeds)
- Automatic or manual shift mode
- Torque converter lockup
- Retarder integration
- Hill start assist

**Gear Selection Principles:**

**Manual Mode:**
- Select gear appropriate for grade and load
- Higher gear = lower engine RPM = better fuel economy
- Lower gear = more engine braking = better control
- Don't lug engine in too high a gear
- Use engine tach as guide

**Automatic Mode:**
- Allow transmission to select optimal gear
- May hunt on undulating terrain
- Less operator workload
- May select lower gear than needed

**Grade Recommendations:**
- **Loaded uphill** - Lower gear, maintain momentum
- **Loaded downhill** - Low gear, use retarder, control speed
- **Empty uphill** - Higher gear acceptable
- **Empty downhill** - Control speed, use retarder

---

### 6.5 Retarder Systems

Modern articulated haul trucks have multiple retarding systems to control speed and reduce brake wear:

**Retarder Types:**

**Engine Brake:**
- Increases engine compression resistance
- Activated by switch or exhaust brake pedal
- Effective at higher RPM
- No heat build-up like service brakes

**Transmission Retarder:**
- Hydraulic resistance in transmission
- Multiple stages of retardation
- Very effective speed control
- Reduces service brake use

**Exhaust Brake:**
- Restricts exhaust flow
- Creates backpressure
- Moderate retarding force

**Service Brakes:**
- Should be used minimally on long descents
- Risk of brake fade if overused
- Monitor brake temperature gauge
- Allow cooling if temperature high

**Proper Use:**
- Select low gear before descent
- Engage retarder early
- Target speed control, not stop-and-go
- Use service brakes for final stop or emergency
- Never ride brakes down long grades

**Source:** Manufacturer specifications and standard operating procedures for retarder systems.
