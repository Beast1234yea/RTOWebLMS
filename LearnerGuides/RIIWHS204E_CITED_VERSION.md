## 4. IDENTIFY AND CONTROL HAZARDS

### 4.1 Identifying Hazards

**Definition:** A hazard is anything that has the potential to cause injury, illness or harm to a person.

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.1: Identifying hazards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

When checking for hazards, look:
- **Up high** above your head
- **All around** you at eye level
- **Down low** on the ground (and underground services)

---

### 4.2 Controlling Hazards - Hierarchy of Control

**The Hierarchy of Control is the preferred method for controlling risks in Australian workplaces.**

The hierarchy ranks risk control measures from highest to lowest level of protection and reliability:

| Level | Control Type | Action | Example for Work at Heights |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------------------|
| **1** | **Elimination** | Completely remove the hazard | Avoid working at height entirely; do work at ground level |
| **2** | **Substitution** | Swap for something less hazardous | Use a work platform instead of a ladder |
| **3** | **Isolation** | Isolate or restrict access to the hazard | Install edge protection/guard rails |
| **4** | **Engineering Controls** | Use equipment to control the risk | Install fall-arrest systems, safety nets |
| **5** | **Administrative Controls** | Site rules and policies | Work permits, training, SWMS, signage |
| **6** | **PPE** | Personal protective equipment | Fall-arrest harness (least effective control) |

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks (Section 3.3: Controlling risks). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-how-manage-work-health-and-safety-risks

---

### 4.3 Hazard Controls Specific to Work at Heights

**WHS Regulations require specific hierarchy for work at heights:**

| Level | Hazard Control for Work at Heights |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| **Level 1** | Completely **avoid carrying out the work at height** |
| **Level 2** | Work only on **solid structures** with safe entry and exit |
| **Level 3a** | Use **fall prevention devices** (guard rails, edge protection) |
| **Level 3b** | Use **work positioning systems** (EWPs, scaffolds) if edge protection can't be used |
| **Level 3c** | Use **fall-arrest systems** (harnesses, safety nets) if prevention/positioning can't be used |

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risk of falls at workplaces (Section 4.1: Hierarchy of control measures). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risk-falls-workplaces

**Important Note:** Fall-arrest systems (harnesses) are the **last line of defence** and should only be used when higher-level controls are not reasonably practicable.

---

## 5. SELECT AND CHECK SAFETY EQUIPMENT

#### 5.2.2 Edge Protection Systems (Guard Rails)

Edge protection systems are barriers installed around edges to prevent falls. They include:

- Handrails
- Mid-rails
- Kickboards
- Containment sheeting
- Safety shutters

**Technical Requirements:**

Edge protection must be designed and installed to provide effective fall prevention. While specific dimensions may vary by situation, guard rails should generally:

- Be capable of withstanding specified loads
- Be installed by competent persons
- Extend to appropriate heights
- Have no gaps that could allow falls

---

### 5.3 Fall-Arrest Systems

Fall-arrest systems are designed to safely arrest a worker's fall and minimise the impact forces. They must only be used when higher-level controls are not reasonably practicable.

#### 5.3.1 Anchor Points

**An anchor point (or anchorage) is a fixed point that fall-arrest equipment connects to.**

**Technical Standard - AS/NZS 1891.4:**

Anchor points must have a minimum breaking strength of:
- **15kN (1,500kg)** for 1 person attached
- **21kN (2,100kg)** for up to 2 people attached

*Note: AS/NZS 1891.4 is an Australian/New Zealand Standard. While this guide references the standard for technical specifications, the full standard text is copyright-protected and available for purchase from SAI Global.*

**Source Reference:** AS/NZS 1891.4:2009 Industrial fall-arrest systems and devices - Part 4: Selection, use and maintenance

**Important:** All anchorages must be tested and approved by a competent person before use.

---

#### 5.3.2 Fall-Arrest Harnesses and Lanyards

**Full-body harnesses must be used when working at heights with fall-arrest systems.**

**Lanyard Requirements:**

Lanyards should:
- Be the correct length for the application
- Not allow free-fall distance greater than 2 metres
- Include energy absorbers to reduce impact forces
- Have double or triple-action snap hooks to prevent accidental release

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risk of falls at workplaces (Section 4.1.4: Fall-arrest systems - Lanyards). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risk-falls-workplaces

---

#### 5.3.3 Limiting Free-Fall Distance

**Critical Safety Requirement:**

> "Fall-arrest systems incorporating a lanyard should be installed so that the maximum distance a person would free-fall before the fall-arrest system takes effect is 2 metres."

To calculate clearance distance, consider:

- The worker's height
- The height and position of the anchorage point
- The length of the lanyard
- Any slack in the horizontal life line
- Stretching of the lanyard or horizontal life line when extended by a fall
- The length of the energy absorber when extended by a fall

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risk of falls at workplaces (Section 4.1.4: Fall-arrest systems - Free-fall distance). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risk-falls-workplaces

---

#### 5.3.4 The Pendulum Effect (Swing Down and Swing Back)

If a worker falls from an edge while using a fall-arrest system, the system may act as a pendulum, causing:

- **Swing down:** Worker hits the ground or lower level
- **Swing back:** Worker swings back into the building or structure

**Control Measures:**

To address the pendulum effect:

1. Install guard rails (prevents the hazard entirely)
2. Place the anchorage point at a right angle to the lanyard position at perimeter edge (use mobile anchorages)
3. Install a second anchorage point with belay devices (intermediate anchorages)

---

### 5.4 Ladders

Ladders can be used for access to and from work areas, but should not be used as work platforms where other options are available.

**Industrial vs Domestic Grade:**

All work at heights should use industrial-grade ladders that:
- Are rated to 120kg minimum
- Are manufactured for industrial use
- Comply with relevant Australian Standards (AS/NZS 1892 series)

**Never use domestic-grade ladders for industrial work.**

**Ladder Setup Requirements:**

- Place on stable, level ground
- Fix at top and base (or have someone foot the ladder)
- Extend at least 1 metre above the stepping-off point
- Set at correct angle: 1m out for every 4m up (1:4 ratio)
- Never use metal ladders near electrical hazards

---

## 6. SUSPENSION TRAUMA

### 6.1 What is Suspension Trauma?

**Suspension trauma (also called suspension intolerance or harness hang syndrome) occurs when a person is suspended vertically in a fall-arrest harness for too long.**

When suspended, blood pools in the legs due to:
- Gravity
- Pressure from the harness leg straps
- Inability to use leg muscles to pump blood back up

This can lead to:
- Loss of consciousness
- Cardiac arrest
- Death (can occur within minutes)

**Source:** Safe Work Australia. (2018). Model Code of Practice: Managing the risk of falls at workplaces (Section 4.1.4: Fall-arrest systems - Suspension trauma). Retrieved November 2025, from https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/model-code-practice-managing-risk-falls-workplaces

---

### 6.2 Preventing Suspension Trauma

**Control Measures:**

✓ **Never work alone** when using fall-arrest systems

✓ **Minimize suspension time** - Rescue within 5 minutes if possible

✓ **Use harnesses** with trauma relief straps or foot loops

✓ **Have rescue procedures** in place before starting work

✓ **Train workers** to move their legs and use relief straps if suspended

**Emergency Response:**

If a worker is suspended in a harness:

1. **Call 000** for ambulance immediately
2. **Rescue as quickly as possible** - time is critical
3. **Keep the person conscious** if possible - talk to them
4. **Allow them to self-rescue** if able (using trauma straps or climbing)
5. **Position upright or semi-reclined** after rescue (NOT lying flat initially)
6. **Seek immediate medical attention** - even if person appears okay
