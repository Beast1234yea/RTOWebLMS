## Assessment Conditions

As a minimum, assessors must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

As a minimum, assessment must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.

Assessment must occur in workplace operational situations. Where this is not appropriate, assessment must occur in simulated workplace operational situations that reflect workplace conditions.

Simulators must not be used in the assessment of this unit of competency.

### Resources for assessment must include access to:
- A suitable mobile slewing crane (open licence - no capacity limit) that is in a safe/serviceable condition in accordance with manufacturer requirements
- Associated rigging equipment for crane operations
- Suitable loads for lifting operations
- Load charts and operational documentation
- Relevant and appropriate materials, tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment currently used in industry
- Suitable set-up area with various ground conditions

### Applicable documentation including:
- Approved codes of practice and relevant guidance material
- Relevant Australian technical standards (AS 1418 series, AS 2550 series)
- Manufacturer guidelines (instructions, requirements, or checklists), relevant industry standards and operating procedures (where applicable)

**IMPORTANT:** Successful completion of this assessment alone does not result in the applicant receiving a HRW Licence. A statement of attainment for this unit is required to allow the applicant to sit for the national licence assessment (High risk work licence).

## Calculations

### Question 1
A mobile crane's load chart shows the following capacities on outriggers fully extended:
- At 10m radius: 45 tonnes
- At 15m radius: 28 tonnes
- At 20m radius: 18 tonnes

You need to lift a steel beam weighing 24 tonnes at a radius of 16 metres. The rigging weighs 1.2 tonnes. Using interpolation, determine if this lift is within the crane's capacity. Show all calculations.

---

### Question 2
Calculate the actual radius for the following lift:
- Hook is positioned 18m horizontally from the centerline of slew
- Boom length being used is 24m
- The load needs to be placed 18m away from the crane

What radius should you use to check the load chart? Is the 18m horizontal distance the same as the working radius?

---

### Question 3
A mobile crane is set up to lift a load with the following:
- Main load: 35.5 tonnes
- Lifting beam: 850kg
- 4 x slings at 95kg each
- 2 x shackles at 38kg each
- Hook block: 420kg

Calculate the total suspended load that must be within the crane's rated capacity.

---

### Question 4
A crane's load chart shows a capacity of 32 tonnes at 12m radius with boom length of 20m. You are using a 15m boom at 12m radius. The chart shows this configuration has a capacity of 38 tonnes. However, you are also using a jib attachment. The jib de-rating table shows a reduction of 15% for this configuration. What is the new rated capacity? Can you safely lift a 30 tonne load plus 1.5 tonnes of rigging?
