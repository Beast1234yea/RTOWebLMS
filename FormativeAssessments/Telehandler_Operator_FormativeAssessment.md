## Calculations

### Question 1
A telehandler load chart shows:
- Boom retracted (3m): 4000kg capacity
- Boom at 6m extension: 2500kg capacity
- Boom at 9m extension: 1500kg capacity

You need to place a load weighing 2200kg at a height requiring 7m boom extension. Using interpolation, is this lift safe?

---

### Question 2
Calculate the total load on the telehandler:
- Pallet of bricks: 1850kg
- Pallet weight: 45kg
- Fork attachment: 120kg

What is the total suspended load? If the load chart shows 2100kg capacity at your boom extension, is the lift safe?

---

### Question 3
A telehandler needs to place materials on the 3rd floor of a building (9.5m high). The load weighs 1600kg including the pallet. The load chart shows:
- At 8m boom extension: 1800kg capacity
- At 10m boom extension: 1400kg capacity

Can this lift be performed safely at 9.5m? Show your calculations.
