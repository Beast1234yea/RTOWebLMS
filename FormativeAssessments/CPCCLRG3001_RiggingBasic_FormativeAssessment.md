As a minimum, assessment must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.

Assessment must occur in workplace operational situations or in simulated workplace operational situations that reflect workplace conditions.

### Resources for assessment must include access to:
- A suitable range of rigging equipment including slings, shackles, and lifting gear that comply with Australian Standards
- Suitable loads for rigging operations
- Load charts and rigging documentation
- Relevant and appropriate materials, tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment currently used in industry

### Applicable documentation including:
- Approved codes of practice and relevant guidance material
- Relevant Australian technical standards (AS 1418, AS 2550, AS 1666, AS 2089)
- Manufacturer guidelines for rigging equipment

## Calculations

### Question 1
Four-leg sling configuration:
- Each sling has a WLL of 2 tonnes in straight vertical lift
- Sling angle from vertical: 45 degrees
- De-rating factor at 45 degrees: 0.7

What is the total capacity of the four-leg sling? Can you safely lift a 4.5 tonne load?

---

### Question 2
You need to use a two-leg sling to lift a load:
- Each leg has a WLL of 3.2 tonnes
- Sling angle from vertical: 30 degrees
- De-rating factor at 30 degrees: 0.87

What is the total lifting capacity? Show your calculations.

---

### Question 3
Calculate the actual load on a single sling leg:
- Load weight: 6 tonnes
- Rigged with 2-leg sling
- Sling angle from vertical: 60 degrees
- At 60 degrees, the load factor is 1.15

What is the actual load on each sling leg? If each sling has a WLL of 4 tonnes, is this lift safe?

---

### Question 4
A beam weighs 3.5 tonnes and is 8 meters long. The center of gravity is 3 meters from one end (not centered). You rig it with two lifting points. If you place the slings at each end:
- End A is 3m from center of gravity
- End B is 5m from center of gravity

What percentage of the load will each sling carry?
