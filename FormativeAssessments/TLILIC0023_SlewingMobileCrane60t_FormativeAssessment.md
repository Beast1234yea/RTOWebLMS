## Assessment Conditions

As a minimum, assessors must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

As a minimum, assessment must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.

Assessment must occur in workplace operational situations. Where this is not appropriate, assessment must occur in simulated workplace operational situations that reflect workplace conditions.

Simulators must not be used in the assessment of this unit of competency.

### Resources for assessment must include access to:
- A suitable mobile slewing crane (rated capacity up to 60 tonnes) that is in a safe/serviceable condition in accordance with manufacturer requirements
- Associated rigging equipment for crane operations
- Suitable loads for lifting operations
- Load charts and operational documentation
- Relevant and appropriate materials, tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment currently used in industry

### Applicable documentation including:
- Approved codes of practice and relevant guidance material
- Relevant Australian technical standards (AS 1418 series, AS 2550 series)
- Manufacturer guidelines (instructions, requirements, or checklists), relevant industry standards and operating procedures (where applicable)

**IMPORTANT:** Successful completion of this assessment alone does not result in the applicant receiving a HRW Licence. A statement of attainment for this unit is required to allow the applicant to sit for the national licence assessment (High risk work licence).

## Calculations

### Question 1
A 60-tonne mobile crane's load chart shows:
- At 8m radius: 38 tonnes capacity
- At 12m radius: 24 tonnes capacity

You need to lift a load weighing 26.5 tonnes at 9m radius. The rigging equipment weighs 850kg. Using interpolation, determine if this lift is safe. Show your calculations.

---

### Question 2
Calculate the total suspended load:
- Main load: 18.5 tonnes
- Spreader bar: 420kg
- 4 x slings at 65kg each
- 4 x shackles at 28kg each
- Hook block: 380kg

What is the total weight that must be checked against the load chart?

---

### Question 3
A crane is configured with:
- Main boom length: 18m
- Working radius: 14m
- Load chart shows 22 tonnes capacity at this configuration

You need to add a 4m swingaway extension. The de-rating table shows a 25% reduction in capacity when using the extension. What is the new rated capacity? Can you safely lift 15 tonnes plus 1.2 tonnes of rigging?
