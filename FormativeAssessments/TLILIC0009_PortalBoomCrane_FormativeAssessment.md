## Calculations

### Question 1
A portal boom crane has a rated capacity of 10 tonnes at a 15-meter radius. Using the load chart, you determine that at a 20-meter radius, the rated capacity is 6 tonnes. You need to lift a load weighing 5.5 tonnes at a 20-meter radius. The rigging equipment weighs 400kg. Is this lift safe? Show your calculations.

---

### Question 2
A portal boom crane's load chart shows:
- At 12m radius: 8 tonne capacity
- At 18m radius: 5 tonne capacity

You need to lift a concrete panel weighing 4500kg using a spreader beam that weighs 350kg and slings that weigh 150kg. The lift will be at a 17m radius. Using interpolation, calculate if this lift is within the crane's capacity.

---

### Question 3
Calculate the total weight that will be imposed on the crane:
- Load weight: 3.2 tonnes
- Lifting beam: 280kg
- 4 x slings at 45kg each
- 1 x shackle at 25kg

What is the total suspended load?
