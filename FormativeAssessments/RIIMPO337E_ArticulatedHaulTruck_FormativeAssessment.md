### Resources for assessment must include access to:
- A suitable articulated haul truck (ADT) that is in a safe/serviceable condition in accordance with manufacturer requirements
- Suitable operational haul roads and dump areas
- Loading equipment (excavators, loaders, etc.)
- Relevant and appropriate materials, tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment currently used in industry

### Applicable documentation including:
- Approved codes of practice and relevant guidance material
- Site-specific operating procedures and traffic management plans

## Calculations

### Question 1
An articulated haul truck has:
- Payload capacity: 38 tonnes
- Tare weight: 24.5 tonnes

You are loaded with 36 tonnes of material. What is the Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM)? Is this within the truck's maximum GVM of 65 tonnes?

---

### Question 2
An articulated dump truck body has a volume of 22 cubic meters. You are hauling blasted rock with a swell factor resulting in a bulk density of 1.65 tonnes per cubic meter. If the body is filled to 95% capacity, what is the weight of the load? (Truck payload capacity is 40 tonnes)

---

### Question 3
Calculate the cycle time:
- Loading time: 8 minutes
- Haul distance: 2.4 km at average speed of 28 km/h
- Dump time: 3 minutes
- Return distance: 2.4 km at average speed of 35 km/h

What is the total cycle time in minutes?
