## Calculations

### Question 1
A belly dump truck has a payload capacity of 45 tonnes and a tare (empty) weight of 28 tonnes. You receive 42 tonnes of material from the loader. What is the Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM)? Is this within the truck's legal road limit of 80 tonnes GVM?

---

### Question 2
A belly dump truck has the following specifications:
- Payload capacity: 50 tonnes
- Body volume: 25 cubic meters

You are hauling material with a density of 1.8 tonnes per cubic meter. If the truck body is filled to 90% capacity, what is the weight of the load? Is it within the payload limit?

---

### Question 3
Calculate fuel consumption for a shift:
- Haul cycle time: 35 minutes
- Fuel consumption rate: 45 liters per hour
- Total operating hours for shift: 10 hours

How much fuel will be consumed during the shift?
