## Assessment Conditions

As a minimum, assessors must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

As a minimum, assessment must satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, which include requirements in the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.

Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.

Assessment must occur in workplace operational situations or in simulated workplace operational situations that reflect workplace conditions in the resources and infrastructure industries.

### Resources for assessment must include access to:
- A suitable dozer (crawler tractor with blade) that is in a safe/serviceable condition in accordance with manufacturer requirements
- Suitable work area for dozing, ripping, or spreading operations
- Relevant and appropriate materials, tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment currently used in industry

### Applicable documentation including:
- Approved codes of practice and relevant guidance material
- Site-specific operating procedures and safety requirements
- Manufacturer guidelines (instructions, requirements, or checklists)
- Relevant Australian standards and site safety requirements
