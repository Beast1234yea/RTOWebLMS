## Calculations

### Question 1
A forklift has a rated capacity of 2500kg at a 500mm load centre. You need to lift a pallet that weighs 2000kg. The load centre of this pallet is 600mm. Using the de-rating formula, is this lift safe? Show your calculations.

**Formula: New Capacity = (Rated Capacity × Rated Load Centre) ÷ Actual Load Centre**

---

### Question 2
A forklift's data plate shows a rated capacity of 3000kg at 600mm load centre. You need to lift a load with a mass of 2400kg at a load centre of 750mm. Calculate whether this lift is within the forklift's capacity. Show your working.

---

### Question 3
A forklift truck is fitted with a side shift attachment. The data plate states:
- Truck capacity without attachment: 2500kg at 500mm LC
- Side shift attachment weight: 150kg
- De-rating factor for side shift: 100kg

What is the new rated capacity of the forklift with the side shift fitted?
