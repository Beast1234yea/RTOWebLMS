## Calculations

### Question 1
A backhoe needs to excavate a trench that is:
- Length: 25 meters
- Width: 0.8 meters
- Depth: 1.5 meters

Calculate the volume of material to be excavated in cubic meters.

---

### Question 2
A backhoe has a bucket capacity of 0.3 cubic meters. You need to excavate 18 cubic meters of material. The bucket can be filled to 90% capacity on average due to material type. How many bucket loads will be required?

---

### Question 3
Calculate the cycle time for loading a truck:
- Bucket filling time: 25 seconds
- Swing to truck: 15 seconds
- Dump time: 8 seconds
- Return swing: 15 seconds

If the truck requires 12 bucket loads, how long will it take to load the truck?
