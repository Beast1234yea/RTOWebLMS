## Scenario-Based Questions

### Question 1
You need to access a roof to inspect equipment. The roof is 4 meters high with a parapet edge. What fall protection measures would you implement?

---

### Question 2
Calculate the total fall distance for this scenario:
- Anchorage point: 5m above ground
- Lanyard length: 2m
- Shock absorber deployment: 1.2m
- Worker height: 1.8m

What is the maximum potential fall distance? Is there sufficient clearance above a ground level of 0m?

---

### Question 3
