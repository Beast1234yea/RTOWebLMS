## 💡 TIPS & BEST PRACTICES

### For Content Development
1. Start with the 🔴 CRITICAL placeholder lessons (life-safety content)
2. Use the assessor guide PDF as the source of truth for content accuracy
3. Each placeholder lesson already has suggested content structure in its HTML
4. Keep lessons concise (10-20 minutes each)

### For Student Experience
1. Publish modules progressively as content is developed
2. Test each module before publishing to students
3. Use the interactive features (3D models, simulations) to enhance engagement
4. Implement knowledge checks after each module

### For Assessment Preparation
1. Build quiz questions directly from the assessor guide
2. Create practice quizzes with immediate feedback
3. Provide mock exams that simulate real assessment conditions
4. Track learner progress and identify weak areas
